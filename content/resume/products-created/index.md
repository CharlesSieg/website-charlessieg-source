[Back to my Resume](/resume)

I started Renkara Media Group in 2008. Through Renkara, I have delivered more than 300 applications to the iOS App Store. These are some of those products.

## ACCELASTUDY

I designed and built AccelaStudy to help people learn foreign language vocabulary faster, to help myself master a deck of Turkish flashcards I had been carrying around for 2 years. AccelaStudy was an immediate success and has grown to millions of users worldwide.

## ACCELASTUDY VOCABULARY BUILDER

Building on the success of AccelaStudy, which was originally designed for foreign language vocabulary, a new product was released which focused on English vocabulary for the GRE, GMAT, ACT, SAT, and TOEFL exams.

## IPHRASEBOOK

iPhraseBook was the world's first expandable phrasebook. Renkara approached HarperCollins and negotiated a license for their excellent phrasebook content, including audio pronunciations. A user can buy iPhraseBook, which comes with English, Spanish, French, German, and Italian, and through In-App Purchases, can install additional languages for the product.

## CONTIG

Contig is a mathematics game where three random numbers are combined with basic math operations to arrive at a number on a gameboard. It is a competitive tournament game in many school districts around the United States. Contig was Renkara's first iPad application and was built before the iPad was released. With no physical device for testing, it was quite a challenge to deliver Contig to the App Store in time for the iPad to ship.

## KANJIPICTOGRAPHIX

A collaboration with award-winning author Michael Rowley, KanjiPictoGraphix delivers Rowley's kanji mnemonics in a beautiful and responsive iPhone and iPad experience. KanjiPictoGraphix took over 2 years to design and build.

## FLASHCARD CHAMPION: BASIC MATH

Flashcard Champion is a math flashcards app for the iPhone. Basic Math was designed for children to help them memorize the basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers 1 - 12. Flashcard Champion was selected as New and Noteworthy by Apple.

## TRANSLATE NOW!

Translate Now! is a universal translator app built on top of the Google Translate service. It was featured by Apple around the world and downloaded over 1,000,000 times.
