# As an iOS Developer

I prefer [Swift](https://swift.org) over [Objective-C](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/Introduction/Introduction.html). I recently converted [AccelaStudy](https://www.accelastudy.com) and associated internal frameworks from Objective-C to Swift, about 30,000 lines of code. The new Swift code is easier to extend and debug; I'm glad I ported it over. It takes forever to compile, though.

Swift's [guard statements](https://thatthinginswift.com/guard-statement-swift/) are the new [assertion](http://blog.krzyzanowskim.com/2015/03/09/swift-asserts-the-missing-manual/) and I use them all over the place. I love Swift's support of [map and reduce](https://useyourloaf.com/blog/swift-guide-to-map-filter-reduce/). I miss [C# async and await](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/async) so I use [then](https://github.com/freshOS/then) which combines promises with async/await.

> I am aware of the [Swift Evolution](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution) proposal for [native Swift support of async and await](https://gist.github.com/lattner/429b9070918248274f25b714dcfc7619). That the proposal is written by [Lattner](http://www.nondot.org/sabre/) himself gives me high hopes that it will be a part of Swift in the near future.

I prefer [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) databases for persistent storage in iOS apps. I never use [CoreData](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CoreData/index.html) but have some affection for [Realm](https://realm.io/products/realm-database). I use [GRDB](https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift) for SQLite access. I use [KiteKit](https://github.com/kitecomp/kitekit) with [Kite Compositor](https://kiteapp.co) or [Lottie](https://airbnb.design/lottie/) from [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com) for creating complex animation sequences. I use [RazzleDazzle](https://github.com/IFTTT/RazzleDazzle) from [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com) for full-screen animated intros. The [socket.io client](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-client-swift) and [Starscream](https://github.com/daltoniam/Starscream) work well for socket programming. I use [CleanroomLogger](https://github.com/emaloney/CleanroomLogger) for logging.

I use [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) to clean up my Swift source code. I like source code files to all adhere to the same coding conventions. I haven't published my own coding conventions but they pretty much look like [this](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-style-guide).

I primarily do my work in [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) but often switch over to [AppCode](https://www.jetbrains.com/objc/) from [Jetbrains](https://www.jetbrains.com). AppCode's plugin architecture allows linting to be done in realtime and features like highlighting code issues such as "unused import" are very helpful.

While I am not a hardcore [Test-Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) afficionado, I do write a lot of unit and integration tests and do so in Xcode for iOS apps. I use Xcode's built-in code coverage tool to measure [code coverage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage). I always have at least 70% code coverage and strive for 100% coverage, though this is a challenge. I try to write my code using [Dependency Injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) and other similar design patterns to enable high code coverage using [mocks and fakes](https://blog.pragmatists.com/test-doubles-fakes-mocks-and-stubs-1a7491dfa3da). I'll give a shout out to [Michael Primeaux](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mprimeaux/) for making me a believer in automated testing.

I aggressively update any open source code that I use. Having a lot of automated tests and a high code coverage gives me the "safety net" in which to do this. I try to keep up with the latest version of Swift but refuse to adopt the latest version of iOS until a month or so before the shipping version is released. On the "bleeding edge" I've spent more time debugging Apple's defects than resolving my own. 

I've used [Fabric](https://get.fabric.io) (previously Crashlytics) and [HockeyApp](https://www.hockeyapp.net) for crash reporting. Since Microsoft bought HockeyApp and made it free for all applications, I now use it exclusively. I've used [mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com) and [Amplitude](https://amplitude.com) for application analytics but now directly use AWS services ([Kinesis](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/) and [Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/)).

I keep all source code under [Git](https://git-scm.com) for version control. I use [GitHub](https://github.com/CharlesSieg?tab=repositories) for personal projects and AWS [CodeCommit](https://aws.amazon.com/codecommit/) for [Renkara](http://www.renkara.com) projects. I've used [Visual SourceSafe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Visual_SourceSafe), [Team Foundation Server](https://www.visualstudio.com/tfs/), and [Subversion](https://subversion.apache.org) in the past but Git is easily the best choice now. I tend to follow [GitFlow](https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/IntroducingGitFlow.html) for managing branches. While I sometimes use the command line, I more often use [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com), [Tower](https://www.git-tower.com/mac/), or [GitHub's desktop client](https://desktop.github.com) for managing Git repos.

I use [TextExpander](https://textexpander.com) to store snippets of code which I insert with a simple keybinding. Most of my Swift keybindings start with the letter *x*. For example, `xtable` pastes in an entire *UIViewController* implementation with a *UITableView* and *UITableViewDataSource* and *UITableViewDelegate* extensions.

I have some talent as a graphics designer and use a combination of [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html) and [Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html) to create screen mockups, icons, and other app-related artwork. I have been an [Adobe Creative Cloud](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud.html) subscriber since it became available. I use [Asset Catalog Creator Pro](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/asset-catalog-creator-pro/id809625456?mt=12) to quickly turn icon source artwork into the [various icon sizes](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/qa/qa1686/_index.html) required by the App Store.

I create app demos and other animations using [Adobe After Effects](https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html).
