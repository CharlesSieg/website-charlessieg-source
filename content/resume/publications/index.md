[Back to my Resume](/resume)

When I was working for UDC, I created a product called UDC Care. It was an early Windows application built with a database product called Paradox for Windows. I wrote about my experience creating UDC Care as a case study which appeared in the September 1995 issue of Paradox Informant magazine. At the time, I was 22 years old.
