I just think it's so cool that "007" makes up this year. After seeing the awesome Casino Royale, the latest James Bond film starring Daniel Craig as Bond, I'm totally pumped about the future of Bond.  

But I digress from the purpose of this post.  

As the quote below would seem, I have an interest in cooking, one that has grown and grown (curse you Ron!) until it now almost qualifies as a hobby. I've even considered taking some time off to go to cooking school. Not as a new profession, mind you, but to formalize my training in the culinary arts.  

This year, as one of my New Year's Resolutions, I am learning 52 new recipes, one every week for the whole year. I imagine I may have to double up on occasion due to being out of town, etc. but I will post about the 52 new things I learn to make. Saturday night is gourmet cooking night here at the Sieg house so expect the new posts late in the weekend or early in the week.
