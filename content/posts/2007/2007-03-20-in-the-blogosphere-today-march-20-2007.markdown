Well, it's been quite awhile since I was regularly writing in this blog. I've written a lot more at my World of Warcraft blog - [World of Warcraft Class Guide](http://www.wowclassguide.com) - than here. But here is a start:    

Apparently it is [more expensive and damaging to the environment (over the life of the vehicle) to drive a Prius](http://clubs.ccsu.edu/recorder/editorial/print_item.asp?NewsID=188) versus a Hummer! Who knew!?!  

A recent clinical study - done by real MDs! - shows that [the "Atlas" chiropractic treatment significantly lowers blood pressure](http://www.webmd.com/hypertension-high-blood-pressure/news/20070316/chiropractic-cuts-blood-pressure) without any side effects.  

The [Highrise shared contact manager](http://www.highrisehq.com/) from 37signals launched today! W00t!  
  
An awesome [new car is being rolled out in India which runs on compressed air](http://www.gizmag.com/go/7000/). Zero pollution, cheap fuel, top speed of 68 mph, and a range of 100km. Not too shabby! The thing would be perfect if they could make it a bit more aerodynamic...
