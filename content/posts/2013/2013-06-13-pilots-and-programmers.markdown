I've recently been asked how long it takes for an experienced .NET developer working in C# to become a useful iOS developer.

As an iOS developer, you will usually be writing code in Objective-C.  Objective-C is the primary language for both iOS and Mac OS X.  At a high level, Objective-C adds Smalltalk-style messaging to the C programming language.  Thus, everything you can do in C, you can also do in Objective-C.
