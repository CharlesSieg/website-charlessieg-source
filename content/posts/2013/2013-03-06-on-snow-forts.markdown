It is a bit of a winter tradition in my family to build snow forts after a decent snowfall.

# The Excavation Model

The first snow fort I remember is from the great blizzard of 1977 (1978?).  I remember that the snowdrifts from that storm were so high that they mostly covered the windows of my parents' kitchen.  Going out the front door must have been quite a challenge.  I remember my dad digging down into this enormous pile of snow and carving out a large room, complete with steps leading down into the room and a bench made of snow in one corner on which to sit.  This snow fort had no roof, however, so I'm not sure how long it lasted before filling in with spindrift.  Alas, I don't seem to have any pictures of this one.

# The Snowdrift Model

When my brother and I were old enough to start making snow forts on our own, we started making them inside snowdrifts.  The curvature of my parents' yard is such that every year a long snowdrift would pile up in the same place - a small hill leading down from the front porch to the driveway.

The design we followed was to start digging into the lowest end of snowdrift at the bottom of the hill and to burrow up into the drift.

The snow that was taken out of the tunnel would be used to build walls just outside the entrance to fortify the structure and provide a wind shield.  If the wind swung around to blow towards the tunnel entrance, the walls there would keep the wind from going up into the tunnel and making it colder inside.

Occasionally, if we had extra snow, we would build one or more snow "guardians" (usually known as snowmen) to further augment the fort's defenses.

There are several advantages to this model:

1.  Small children can pretty easily make a snowdrift fort.  My brother and I were only 6 or 7 years old when we started making them.  Drift snow tends to be light and there is minimal shoveling involved.  Most of the hard work is in removing the excavated snow from the tunnel.
2. Building a snow fort in a drift on a downward slope makes it easier to get the snow out of the tunnel.  This saves a ton of energy.  The usual method is to excavate at the terminal end of the tunnel.  The excavated snow will usually pile up near the excavator's head.  Then the snow needs to be pulled and pushed by hand until the snow is at the excavator's feet.  Then it's just a matter of kicking the snow down the tunnel, scoot down to the kicked snow, kick, scoot, and repeat until the snow is out of the tunnel.  Much, much easier going downhill.
3.  Cold air falls down and warm air rises so the cold air in the tunnel tends to exit the snow fort and the warm air stays in, making the whole thing quite a bit warmer than you would expect a structure made of snow to be.  As it turns out, igloos are built this way also - the interior is higher than the entrance so that the cold air slides out of the igloo. http://static.ddmcdn.com/gif/igloo-2a.gif
4. The warm air melts the snow inside just a bit and this melted snow then freezes up again overnight.  This has the effect of making an icy "shell" which strengthens the structure.

Unfortunately, there are some disadvantages to this design:

1.  Drifts are usually made of fluffy, lightweight snow which does not pack or compress very well.  Thus, it is often not suitable for digging into until the day or so after the snow storm.  This means that on the critical "snow day" off from school, no progress is made in construction and all work is done on weekends or in the limited light of evenings.
2. Drifts depend on lots of wind to form.  This means that a snow "fall" might not yield a useful pile of snow in which to build.  Typically a snow "storm" is needed - a full blown blizzard is ideal - in order to have a useful snowdrift.
3. The size of the snow fort is limited to the size of the drift.  The width of the tunnel is limited usually to the width of a single person.  This means that in order to get two people into such a fort, the snow fort has to be long enough to fit them in end to end.  The person who goes in first cannot be the claustrophobic type because there is no way out until the second person exits.  The tunnel is usually not very tall so there is no room to sit up much less stand.  So, in general, snowdrift forts are better for a single person or small children.

# On Safety

The question I always get about building these kinds of snow forts is "what happens when they cave in?"

The answer is that I have no idea because it has never happened to me.  It has, apparently, [happened on rare occasion to others](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/story/2011/03/07/snow-fort-death-chambly-warning.html).

Snow is probably the weakest building material on earth.  However, compacted snow is surprisingly strong.  Compacted snow is used to [make roads and runways](http://eprints.lib.hokudai.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2115/20355/1/2_p993-1005.pdf).  Snow forts tend to melt and refreeze repeatedly, strengthening the structure.  This melting and refreezing also improves the insulation quality of the snow fort. 

I've built snow forts that you could walk on top off without falling in and snow forts that doubled as sled runs, where the sled would slide over the roof of the snow fort using it as a kind of ramp. 

That said, we follow many safety precautions:

1.  Don't build a snow fort in which you can fit your entire body by yourself.  We tend to build snow forts in pairs - one person inside excavating, one person outside clearing the snow.
2. If you are building a snow fort with small children around, pay attention to what they are doing.  If they are climbing on top of the snow fort, don't go inside it.
3. Never leave your children alone while they are playing in the snow fort.  Be aware of where they are at all times.
4. Don't build your snow fort by a road.  This is sort of obvious in that you don't want a car that slides on some ice to come careening into your snow fort but, more subtly, the vibrations of moving vehicles, particularly snow plows, on the road can vibrate and destabilize the snow.
5. Don't build you snow fort in a pile of snow that was made by a snow plow or that has foriegn materials such as gravel or leaves in it.  It's much better to make your own pile of snow off in an isolated corner of your yard out of pristine, recently fallen snow.
6. Leave the walls and ceilings of the snow fort at least 5-6 inches in thickness.
7. When in doubt, carry a few buckets of water over to the snow fort and splash some water onto the walls.  Then spread out and smooth the slushy snow.  When it refreezes this will essentially convert your snow fort into an ice fort making it much, much stronger.


One thing to note about making snow forts like this is that snow is highly transparent.  Normal daylight can be seen through 4-5 inches of snow.

# Current Version

This year's snow fort is a Snowpile Model.  Built in our backyard where there is, essentially, no drifting, any sizeable snow fort needs to be made out of a manmade pile of snow.  My sons are 4 and (almost) 3 years old so that work falls to daddy, thus limiting the scale of the snow fort.
