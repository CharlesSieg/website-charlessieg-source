In today's digital world of social networking websites, texts, and email, it has become truly uncommon to send or receive a handwritten letter, on actual paper, delivered in a physical envelope by a real person.

I try to write one handwritter letter to a random person every month. I think it is a great way to reach out and let someone know that they are important enough to receive something tangible.
