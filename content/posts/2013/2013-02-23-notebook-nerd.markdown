Most people who know me probably get the understandable impression that I am a "paperless" guy.  This is mostly true as I regularly use Evernote, nvALT, Dropbox, and other apps to store notes and documents online.

However, there are still times that I find myself wanting to unplug and write or sketch on actual paper and on these occasions, I use an actual notebook.


All through high school and college I took notes on loose sheets of paper or in those spiral-bound 3-subject Mead notebooks.  I still have most of these notebooks in a filing cabinet but they are falling apart - not the greatest paper or the most durable binding.

My notetaking abilities were not particularly great and I was often more interested in how many notes I could cram onto a single page as opposed to favoring a useful structure.

In all the years I was bodybuilding, I kept detailed logs of every workout - every set, rep, and weight.  I used the familiar black and white log books used in labs, etc.  These were an improvement over the spiral bound stuff but still not particularly great quality.

In my professional life, doing work as a consultant, I found myself in meeting after meeting needing to take copius notes.  Initially I carried over my Mead habit but quickly decided to move to something more durable and attractive.

I tried many variations.

Eventually, though, in an Office Depot in downtown Chicago, I found what has become my standard notebook: hardcover, perfect bound notebooks, not dissimilar to accounting journals.  Over the years, I've filled quite a few of these.

They are great for endless streams of text and pictures.

I try to write all the way to the last page before switching to another notebook but sometimes I need a clean start and stop early, particularly if it has been a long time since I wrote something.

Recently, I discovered several websites which allow you to order custom versions of these hardback books. The BookFactory, for example, has many types of notebooks, including engineering notebooks, research notebooks, and student lab notebooks.

There are several features I like about these notebooks.

1.  The notebook can have its cover imprinted with a custom title or logo, such as “Brain Droppings, Volume 1”.
2. Books can be imprinted with a number so that notebooks can be ordered.
3. Page numbers in a given book can start at any number.  So, volume 1 pages could be 1 to 500 and volume 2 pages could be 501 to 1000.
2. The bound pages can be of various layouts, including columns, forms, and grids.
