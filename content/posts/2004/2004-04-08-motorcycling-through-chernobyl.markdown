I ran across this [link](http://www.kiddofspeed.com/chapter1.html) on the Internet yesterday. It's written by a woman who lives near the city and rides her Kawasaki Ninja on the roads around the city. She says its the best place in the world to ride because there are no cars or people anywhere to be seen and, therefore, the roads are wide open. She says the roads are in perfect condition because there is no wear and tear on them from constant traffic. Only the occasional blade of grass pokes through a minute crack in the pavement.  

  

If I were her, I'd be *very* careful riding my rocket bike through the No Man's Zone of Chernobyl. If you wipe out in there, ain't no one coming to get you...
