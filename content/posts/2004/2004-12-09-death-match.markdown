I loved this novel. I read it while I was in Turkey for J's wedding at the end of October. What an interesting glimpse into the future. The premise regards a huge, innovative company whose primary product is a near-perfect matchmaking service. Behind the service is an AI construct which uses a variety of complicated algorithms to pair men and women together.  

  

While this seems fairly benign, it all gets very intriguing when one of these matches ends up a murder/suicide. What really makes it interesting is that the pair is what the company calls a "supercouple" or two people who came out as perfect 100% matches.  

  

What makes the book so very fascinating for me is the AI. The author really delves into how it is constructed and how it has evolved over time from a simple application to the ultra powerful and intelligent entity it grows into.  

  

Highly recommended.
