I really enjoyed this novel from James Rollins. I think I've read all of his books at this point, except maybe one...have to check on that. This one, all 460+ pages, was read over two days. It was tough to put down. The premise of the book centers around some interesting items found at the bottom of the ocean.  

  

I always find this type of premise very intriguing. The "item at the bottom of the sea" idea is used in countless novels by Clive Cussler, Jack DuBrul, and others. It's an easy way to captivate the reader because almost everyone has a special interest in the hidden secrets of the ocean. Just thinking of what could be at the bottom of the sea invokes thoughts of Atlantis, sunken ships, sea monsters, and lost planes. It's a genre that requires a lot of research because there are special problems with going deep underwater that a technical reader like me finds fascinating. This book delivers on the technical side and also gets into a little international politics ultimately demonstrating why we the United States must always pursue diplomatic means over warfare. However, that's a whole other topic. For a good read, get this book, but free up your schedule because you won't be able to put it down.
