Wow, we are having a heat wave in Chicago today! It's almost 35 degrees warmer today than it was last Thursday or so. That's the good news. The bad news is that we are still below freezing. That's right. The temperature is 35 degrees warmer and still below 32 degrees. Thursday it was -7. There is just something totally wrong about living in a climate where the temperature can vary so greatly and still be so freakin' cold. Totally, totally wrong...offensively wrong...
