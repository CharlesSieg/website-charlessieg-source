I claim victory over the spambot that was attacking my website. I crush it like grape between my fingers. Crush it!!!




I have not received any spam now for 2 days! I designed a dynamic form generator that creates different field names for each field on the comment form every time the form is loaded. So what used to be the "Name" field on the form is now the "2348234" field. My users won't notice a difference but my comment module will no longer accept the comment submissions from the spambot using static field names! It's possible that a programmer could write a new spambot just for submitting comments to my website that handles my new algorithm but why bother?




Free again from the tyranny of the spam overlord! All your base are belong to us!!!
