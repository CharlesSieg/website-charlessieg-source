I was thinking the other day about how I had not written a letter with pen and paper in years and years. In fact, I may not have scribed such a message since I was a child. I realized that I rely completely on email to communicate with friends and family. Of course I still use that archaic device, the telephone, from time to time but pretty much send electronic mail whenever I want to reach out and touch someone.  

  

Truth be told, I realized that I barely write in cursive any more. Whenever I have to write on paper, I always print. I only ever use cursive to sign my name and, as my wife will gladly attest, no one could possibly read my signature. So I experimented a bit and tried to write a few sentences in cursive. This endeavor was sort of successful. I can still write in cursive but it takes me about 12 seconds to write a [7 letter word](http://www.math.toronto.edu/jjchew/scrabble/club3/season/2002-2003/lessons/08.html).  

  

So I got to thinking about other "lost arts" related to writing. My wife was telling me that when she was a little girl, they still used little bottles of ink. I have never seen one of these little bottles of ink. If I try to visualize a little bottle of ink, I inevitably see it on a desk next to a [quill pen wielded by Benjamin Franklin](http://www.philaprintshop.com/images/frankchamb.jpg). Does anyone write with this type of ink now? My own preferred writing utility is a [Velocity Gel](http://www.cleansweepsupply.com/pages/item-bicrlc11bk.html) pen.  

  

Which got me thinking about calligraphy. When Ahu and I got married, we had a poster made up which listed all of the names of our wedding guests. The list was done completely in calligraphy. I thought it was a very elegant touch. It was amazing to me, though, that it was so hard to find a calligrapher. The whole art of calligraphy is practiced only by a handful of creative individuals, it seems. Nowadays you have to hire someone to truly generate a worthwhile "[John Hancock](http://www.archives.gov/national_archives_experience/declaration_zoom_2.html)".  

  

Which reminded me of a little shop I ran across while walking to the [Bergisel](http://www.forkbender.com/ViewImages.aspx/gk/723174af96fc4b1e98d5290d1d3a466d/ik/138c48040d22498d8086eae392d0e1fa) in Innsbruck, Austria. There I was, walking from the hotel to the ski jump when I passed by this little writing tools shop. I had never seen a shop dedicated to only *writing* tools so I had to take a look. They had all kinds of interesting pens and inks but they had one display which had something I had never seen in person and seen only in the movies - wax sealing tools.  

  

I decided then and there that I would start sending real paper-based letters again. And I would seal them with [wax](http://www.nostalgicimpressions.com/mall/sealing.asp)! And I would brand them with a special [monogram](http://www.nostalgicimpressions.com/mall/monograms.asp)! Anyone can send an email. There's nothing special about email. But sending a hand-written letter, in such an elegant fashion, that's a great way to let someone know they are special.  

  

Pretty soon, once we get moved into our new house, I'm going to start sending letters. So if you have a strange letter delivered someday, and it's sealed with wax and branded with a big "S", you'll know who it's from!
