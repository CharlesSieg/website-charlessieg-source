The movie Pulp Fiction has a ton of great scenes. One of my favorites is when Vincent takes Mia to the restaurant and she orders a special milkshake:









Mrs. Mia Wallace:


A five dollar shake.






Buddy Holly:


How do you want that shake: Martin and Lewis or Amos and Andy?






Mrs. Mia Wallace:


Martin and Lewis.






Vincent Vega:


Did you just order a five dollar shake?






Mrs. Mia Wallace:


Ummhh.






Vincent Vega:


That's a shake . . . that's milk and ice cream.






Mrs. Mia Wallace:


Last I heard.






Vincent Vega:


That's five dollars? You don't put bourbon in it or nothin'?






Buddy Holly:


No.





Vincent Vega:


Just checking.
