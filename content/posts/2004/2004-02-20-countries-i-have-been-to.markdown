I've decided to start keeping track of the countries I've been to before I forget them. The number after the country name is the number of times I've been there. If there is an asterisk (*) then I've only been in the country during transit, i.e. on the way to another country and thus I've only seen the airport.




  1. **United States.** Duh, I live here, but still it's a country and going on my list.


  2. **Canada (2).** This was the first country I went to outside of the United States. I went here first with my parents when we were visiting Niagara Falls. Went once also when I was working the BuyPower project at GM in Detroit around October 1999.


  3. **Mexico (5).** This is the country I've been to the most, mainly because I go to Cancun for warm, tropical-type getaways. August 1995 - [Fiesta Americana Coral Beach](http://www.hotels-cancun.com/fiestacoralbeach/)?
