I recently found myself surrounded by college-age kids discussing pointillism. Pointillism is the technique of applying many small strokes or dots of color to a surface so that when viewed at distance, the dots come appear to come together in a larger, cohesive image.  

  

The technique was invented by the Impressionist painter [Georges Seurat](http://www.discoverfrance.net/France/Art/Seurat/Seurat.shtml) and is used with vivid success in the [painting](http://www.artchive.com/artchive/s/seurat/jatte.jpg) _Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte_ which is currently displayed at the [Art Institute of Chicago](http://www.artic.edu).  

  

A number of the kids had not seen the painting or anything like it so I said "Well, do you remember that painting that [Cameron](http://www.80s.com/saveferris/images/art/picture14.jpg) was entranced by in the movie [Ferris Bueller's Day Off](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091042/)?" because that was the painting in question.  

  

I was met, quite depressingly, by the response "Ferris who???"
