Two of my favorite people got engaged this past weekend! I'm really excited and happy for them - they are a great match for each other! I was lucky enough to be around when they met and to see them become friends and to see that friendship grow into something much more. I always hoped that the guy would be smart enough to realize what an amazing woman he was with and, apparently, after all his crazy misadventures, he is. She has a beautiful ring and I'm certain his proposal was very memorable. So congratulations to both of you! I wish you the best!
