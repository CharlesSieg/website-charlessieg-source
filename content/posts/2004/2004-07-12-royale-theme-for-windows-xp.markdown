The theme used for Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005 is called Royale. It's a very attractive and elegant theme. I now use it on all of my workstations. You can see screenshots [here](http://www.winbeta.org/images/mce2005/MCE.2005.Royale.jpg), [here](http://www.winbeta.org/images/mce2005/wb-royaledisp.gif), and [here](http://www.winbeta.org/images/mce2005/wb-royaleopera.gif). You can download it from [here](http://sabias.blogspot.com/2004/07/theme-royale-para-xp.html). Once you unzip it, put the DLL in the c:windowsresourcesthemes directory and double-click the Royal.msstyle file to install it.
