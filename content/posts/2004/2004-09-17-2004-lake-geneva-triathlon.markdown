What a great triathlon this was! This was the third time at this event for Ahu and I. My brother Randy Sieg competed for the first time. This was also his first triathlon. We did the Sprint distance consisting of a 1/2 mile swim, 17 mile bike ride, and 5K run. Ahu and I both set personal records. I improved my swim by almost 3 minutes over last year and improved by bike time by almost 10 minutes, finishing the bike phase in less than an hour for the first time. I also finished the triathlon in less than 2 hours for the first time. Randy, however, beat us both with an outstanding swim and run time and a very good bike time for his first effort (and on a mountain bike as well).
