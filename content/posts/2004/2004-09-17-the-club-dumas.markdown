Along the lines of The Eight, this novel is a highly intellectual fictional rendering. All of the author's books start off in Castilian Spanish and are translated to English by Sonia Soto. The author was formerly a Spanish journalist and has a rich knowledge of European history, music, literature, as well as geography and eccelesiastical facts. The Club Dumas is about rare books and 19th century serial fiction. There is an occult touch also which lends a slightly horrific turn to the story. Another recommended novel but be sure to have a Latin dictionary close at hand to look up some of the ancient text included in the novel.
