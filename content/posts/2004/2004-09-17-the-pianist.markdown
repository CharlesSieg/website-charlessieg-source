I found this movie to be very disturbing but an excellent movie nonetheless. It was disturbing in a different way than The House of Sand and Fog was. This time the bad feelings came from the treatment of the Polish Jews by the German soldiers. Its truly unsettling to see fellow humans treated like animals. It was a tragic time and the story is about a famous pianist who manages to survive the war. Definitely worth seeing at least once. I rented the movie through Netflix and then bought the soundtrack, which is filled with moving classical piano pieces.
