I have finally discovered [eBay](http://www.ebay.com). You'd think being a web developer and all, and especially one who thrived and survived in the dotcom bubble days, that I would have discovered it before. But, alas, it always seemed a little too good to be true for me. When I think of auctions, I usually think of some old guy with a loud voice selling off junk seized in a police drug raid.  

  

As many "eBayers" do, I started off looking for a good price on a single item. For me, believe it or not, that item was an [overhead projector](http://www.aviinc.com/ebay/brand/Dukane/Startfire.jpg) (yes, the kind your grade school teacher used) that had an intensity of at least 3,000 lumens. Why? Well, let's just say I'm working on a [project](http://www.tomshardware.com/howto/20041201/index.html). So i started looking around on eBay. The model I linked to above retails on the 'net for around $400. It's on eBay for $56 (my current leading bid) plus $25 shipping and handling. That's a pretty good deal if you ask me.  

  

So I started to wonder what other good deals they might have. To make a long story short, I have now won 5 auctions this week and have bids on another dozen items or so. Most of them are long shots and will most likely not win, but sometimes you get lucky.  

  

I have gotten two items on eBay that I plan to give as Christmas gifts. I bought a 20" Dell flat panel LCD monitor for $370. I bought two sets of mint condition movie posters (4 posters for The Last Samurai and 4 for Matrix Reloaded). I also bought a mint condition movie poster for Goldeneye. Unfortunately, to my great disappointment, I was chopped off at the knees by some jerk who outbid me at the last second on an 8' x 6' vinyl banner of Mr. Incredible from the fantastic Pixar movie. Aargh!  

  

The whole thing is about as addictive as those new Mint Oreos. Just when the diet gets going, out comes another must-have cookie...but that's another article. Anyway, I'll let you know how it goes.
