title: China On the Verge of Conquering SARS

I read a happy, yet aggravating, news item in the MIT Technology Review today. A drug company in China is putting a SARS vaccine into human trials this month. That's right, they've _already_ got a vaccine for SARS. Of course, it might not work, but considering SARS has only been around for maybe TWO years max, I think that's pretty good. In fact, I bet the AIDS patients around the world who have HIV and have been waiting for a vaccine for TWENTY years are kind of ticked off. China cranks out a SARS vaccine in 2 years and the U.S. can't figure out HIV in 20 years. Just wait until their full-blown stem cell program gets going. China has no restrictions on stem cell research so they are light years ahead of the U.S. there. It won't be long before all the new drugs are coming from China and other non-restricted Asian companies. Of course, we won't be able to get any of these drugs because of the FDA but that's another rant...
