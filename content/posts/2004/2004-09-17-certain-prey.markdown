This is book 10 in the Prey series. I enjoyed this one immensely. There are two "villains" in this novel, both of whom are women. You find out who they are right at the beginning and then the rest of the novel goes back and forth between the villain narrative and the Lucas Davenport narrative. Both are worthy adversaries. One of the women is truly an imaginative piece of work.
