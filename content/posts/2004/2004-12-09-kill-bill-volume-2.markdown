Another excellent movie and a very good sequel from Quentin Tarantino. Not quite as good as the first but still great. Each movie was written in its own style and are completely different from each other. This one focuses less on the martial arts and more on character development and story.  

  

Every scene in the movie is memorable but the two that really stand out for me are the scene with Pai Mei and the scene where the Bride goes after Budd. The Pai Mei scene reminded me of Bloodsport where Van Damme is getting his training. The scene with Budd is just classic. Can't say any more than that. You'll just have to see it.  

  

The best part about this movie is that as a sequel, there is no wasted time on repetitive background. It picks up and runs and completely assumes that you saw the first one. If you didn't, well, you idiot. Anyway, awesome movie. Rent it, watch it, and buy it for your collection.
