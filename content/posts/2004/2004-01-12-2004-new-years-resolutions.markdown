Yes, yes, I am taking the unusual step of sharing my NY resolutions with the whole world. I have no issues with this because I plan on sticking to all of them and letting others know what they are just further cements the commitment. So, here they are:






  1. **Get bodyweight down to 185.** This is my number one goal because its important for my health as well as my sense of well-being. There are, really, countless positive reasons to lose some weight and no negative reasons. I will continue to enjoy the same foods but less of them and punctuated by exercise.


  2. **Rescind membership to the Clean Plate Club.** See my article below titled "Demise of the Clean Plate Club"...


  3. **Bench press 365 lbs.** This was my 2003 goal but I only hit 325 before the New Year. I actually hope to do better than 365 in 2004 but will only commit to 365. Now those of you who are going "Only 325?", I don't want to hear it. I ran triathlon all summer and its NOT conducive to building strength. I started benching again in November after not having benched since March. I could barely do 225 for 4 in November and 275 for 1. Now I can do 225 for almost 20 and 325 for 1. Not bad for about 9 weeks of training...


  4. **Maintain a healthy tan year-round.** In general, this means spend some time outside during the summer. However, the "year-round" part means I need to hit the tanning bed in the other 3 seasons. The "healthy" part means that I only use high-pressure tanning beds for the most part with only the occasional session in a typical UVB bed.


  5. **Finish an Olympic distance triathlon.** I've done a few sprint distance triathlons and now its time to move up the difficulty level. Resolution 1 above is mandatory for this resolution to be achievable.


  6. **Go for my "once-every-two-years" physical in February or March.** My last physical was right before I was married. It's now almost 2 years later and I am curious to see how I am doing. As of this writing, however, I am 18 lbs. heavier than I was before I got married, hence, Resolution 1 again. I get my physical done with [Executive Health Exams](http://www.executivehealthexams.com/). They are quite thorough and do every test you can think of.


  7. **Release Narrative with source code to the public.** Should be out before March 1 now. I've only been working on it since last May...


  8. **Attempt to dress my age.** Isn't that funny?!? I'm going to be 32 this year and I still dress like Vencel (don't ask if you don't already know). We shall see...


  9. **Attend the Microsoft PDC in the fall.** Costs a lot but last year's conference was sold out, for a reason. This year, I will be there.




That's it, so far. I might think of a few others later. Normally I have some other goals related to travel and things like that but this year I just want to move into our new house and stay home for awhile.
