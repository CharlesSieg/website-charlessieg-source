Election Day is November 2nd this year. Election Day is always the Tuesday after the first Monday of November. Since Monday is the 1st, we have the earliest Election Day that is possible.  

  

The timing is a bit unfortunate for me this year as I will be in Istanbul, Turkey on Election Day. I really want to vote this year so I need to figure out this whole absentee ballot concept. I'll let you know how it goes.
