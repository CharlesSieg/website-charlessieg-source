Just like I started keeping track of countries I've been to, now I am keeping track of states I have been to in the United States. Found a neat little map on [World66](http://www.world66.com) which allows me to highlight the states I've been to.




  1. **Illinois.** Lived here my whole life.


  2. **Indiana.**
