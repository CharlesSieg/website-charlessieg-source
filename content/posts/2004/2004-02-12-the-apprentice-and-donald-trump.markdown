Those who know me know I hardly ever watch television. I don't have time for it. I work my 40-45 hours a week, come home, and then I work on Narrative all night or work out. Sometimes I turn on the TV over dinner. Tonight I did that and caught [The Apprentice](http://www.nbc.com/The_Apprentice/) with [Donald Trump](http://www.askmen.com/men/business_politics/38_donald_trump.html). I'm not a big fan of reality shows but I was very impressed by this one. And I can also say that it is obvious why Donald Trump is The Man. He is sharp, decisive, fair, and intelligent, a formidable combination. The group dynamics in the show tonight were fascinating and the conclusion was surprising and intense. I feel I even learned a few things watching him and the others during the show. I plan on watching The Apprentice every Thursday night. It's an hour well-spent.
