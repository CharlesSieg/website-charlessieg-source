The news that every [Best Western hotels in the US](http://www.usatoday.com/travel/news/2004-01-23-best-western-internet_x.htm) will have free wireless is awesome! I became a Best Western fan when Ahu and I were travelling through Europe on our honeymoon. We could pretty much count on finding a BW in almost every city we went and could rely on the quality being relatively good in each one. The fact that they are offering free WiFi now makes it a good choice for us in the US as well. I am hoping that this will encourage other hotels to provide similar service and pricing. Nothing I hate more than going to a hotel and having to pay a $10 or more daily free for Internet access.
