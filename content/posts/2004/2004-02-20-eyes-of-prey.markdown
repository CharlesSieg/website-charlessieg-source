This is one dark book. This is the third book in the Prey series by John Sandford. I really enjoy reading this series (there are 14 books in the series now) and watching the development of the Lucas Davenport character. In this book, Sandford introduces the Michael Bekker villain. He is the darkest and freakiest serial murderer I've read about in a long time. This book drains you when you read it as it takes a lot to steel yourself against the evil in Bekker's personality. Davenport has a tough time in this book and you feel it right along with him. I was going to go right into the fourth book but my mind needs a rest.
