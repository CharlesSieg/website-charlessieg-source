This excellent book details the challenges in creating the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893. Leading American architects, led by Daniel Burnham, designed and built what became known as the "White City". At the same time, however, a sinister serial killer was prowling the Fair eventually killing somewhere between 27 and 200 people, mostly young women.
