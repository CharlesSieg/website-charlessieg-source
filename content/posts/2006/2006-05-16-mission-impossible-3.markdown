I had an urge to see an action movie last week and so Ahu and I went to see MI:3 midweek at the Loews Theater in Schaumburg. I'm not sure why this movie is doing so badly at the theater. It's a really great action movie. There are a number of awesome stunts and a lot of good special effects. The plot isn't really that bad - again, this is an action movie! Action movie plots are always a touch unbelievable. Tom Cruise does a very good Ethan Hunt once again and Laurence Fishburne has a nice role also. Not sure if it was worth the price that movie theaters extort these days but definitely a good choice for DVD.
