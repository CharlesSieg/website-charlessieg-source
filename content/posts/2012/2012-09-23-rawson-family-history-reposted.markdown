A few years ago I posted a [PDF of the Rawson Family History](http://www.charlessieg.com/rawson.pdf) that was researched and compiled by my great grandmother Ruth Rawson Meng.  Over the many migrations of my blog, the PDF was misplaced.  I have now replaced it and it is now available again for review.  I get Google search hits on my blog daily for people around the world searching for "Rawson family history" so hopefully this will help.  Please feel free to write me at crsieg (at) gmail.com if you have any questions.
