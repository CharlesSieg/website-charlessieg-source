I went to see the new James Bond movie - Skyfall - recently with Ahu.  We saw it in a matinee IMAX presentation at the AMC 30 in South Barrington.  The IMAX treatment was awesome, if a little loud.  The decibel meter app on my iPhone went as high as 110 decibels during the movie with an average of 97 throughout.

Skyfall is remarkably different than any previous Bond film and I wanted to write down some of my thoughts and impressions of the movie.  There are spoilers ahead so stop reading now if you haven't seen the film.

This Bond film is about failure.  In looking back over every assignment given to Bond, Bond "cocks it up" every time.  I've never seen a Bond so unsuccessful in getting the job done.



On the upside, I really enjoyed the ending of the movie and the introduction of Moneypenny and the new M.  Hopefully both characters will continue to have the same actors for some time as they appear excellently suited for them.
