I recently wrote a [post on my old blog](http://charlessieg.posterous.com/108547915) about my predictions for "the new iPad" that was released in March.  Let's look and see how accurate my predictions were:




**New Retina display**.  Completely correct, down to the resolution.  Pretty much a no-brainer.




**Faster processor but not the A6**.  Also correct.  Instead of an A6, Apple went with a new version of the A5 with a faster GPU.




**1080p video / iPhone 4S camera**.  Essentially correct.  Video is 1080p and the camera is almost identical to the iPhone 4S except that it has fewer megapixels.




**More storage**.  Unfortunately, this one fell through.  I was hoping for a 128 GB version but Apple stayed with 64 GB as the largest storage option.  As a checkpoint, I am using 32 GB of that so far, without having loaded any music or video.




**LTE/4G**.  Bingo.  The Verizon LTE option is super fast.  Apple also solved the problem with the battery draining quickly using LTE.




**Siri**.  Nope.




**Bluetooth 4.0**.  Yup.




**iOS 5.1**.  Yup.




**Apple TV with Siri**.  This one was always a stretch and it didn't pan out.  Hopefully this will still come true one day.




**Microsoft Office for iPad**.  Not sure what happened here.  I think this is still on its way but it was not ready for the launch and it is not available one month later.




**Aperture**.  Not quite.  Instead, Apple went with iPhoto for iOS, which I'm not particularly impressed with.  I have it and have tried to use it a few times.  Complicated, unintuitive UI.




**Improved iMovie**.  Yup, had to given the new 1080p video.




**Smart downloads**.  Nope.  Universal binaries are really big.  To compensate:




**Increased OTW app installs on LTE**.  Correct and then some.  Apple increased OTW installs to 50 MB over all wireless carrier networks.




**Slightly thicker case**.  Yes, but only by a few millimeters and the old Smart Cover still works fine.




**Battery life will decrease slightly**.  This is somewhat subjective but my experience is that it has decreased a bit.  Not that you would notice in a day's work.




**Price increase**.  Nada.  Same prices as always.  This might be the most amazing trick Apple is able to pull off.




**Name will be iPad HD or iPad 2 HD**.  Nope, but not iPad 3, either.  It's "the new iPad"…alrighty then.




**iPad 2 continues to be available**.  Yup, and is still a big seller.




**NFC** (not going to happen).  Correct.  No sign of it.




**Purchases for iTunes movie**.  I pegged this as "unlikely" but Apple did manage to swing it and allow redownloads of purchased iTunes movies.  Awesome.




**World of Warcraft**.  Yeah, keeping dreaming.




So there were 22 predictions and I was right on 14 of them and I'd say half right on 2 more.  So let's say 15 of 22.  About 68% correct, which is not too bad in the world of Apple hardware predictions.
