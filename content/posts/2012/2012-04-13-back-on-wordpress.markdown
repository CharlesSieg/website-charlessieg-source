For the past year (maybe longer?) my blog has been hosted on [Posterous](http://www.posterous.com).  It's still there at [http://charlessieg.posterous.com](http://charlessieg.posterous.com).  However, Posterous was recently acquired by Twitter and I suspect their days of focused blog hosting are coming to a close.  Thus, I have moved my blog back to [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org), hosted at [Rackspace](http://www.rackspace.com), and am looking forward to doing more writing soon.

When I have time, I'll look into porting the content I created on the old site over to this new site.

I'm currently using this theme temporarily until I find something I really like or have time to roll my own.
