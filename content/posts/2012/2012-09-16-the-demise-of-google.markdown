Within the next 5-10 years, I believe that we will see the end of Google as a major player in the technology industry.

This is the first article in an 8-part series that I have written analyzing Google's business practices and strategy, and arguing that these will lead to Google's eventual demise.

All articles here are my own personal opinion and not related to or endorsed by my company, Renkara Media Group.

### The Good Old Days

There was a time when I was Google's biggest fan, a time when I despised Apple products and software.  I couldn't imagine using a Macintosh computer for doing any serious work.  I refused to buy anything from iTunes and specifically avoided buying an early iPod.  In those days, my brands of choice were [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com), [Dell](http://www.dell.com), and [Sony](http://www.sony.com) and I looked forward to a time when all of my software was powered by Google apps and all of my data was safely stored in Google's cloud.  My wife and I even looked at the possibility of Google employment when she, with her doctorate in computer science focused on personalized search and recommendation, was flown out to California and interviewed at Google at Google's invitation and expense. 

Today I own a [company](http://www.renkara.com) which makes [educational software](http://www.accelastudy.com) used by almost 10,000,000 people that runs exclusively on Apple's [iPhone](http://www.apple.com/iphone), [iPad](http://www.apple.com/ipad), and [iPod touch](http://www.apple.com/ipod) devices.  I do all of my work on Apple's [Macintosh computers](http://www.apple.com/mac).  I buy music, TV shows, and movies on [iTunes](http://www.apple.com/itunes) and enjoy them via one of the four [Apple TVs](http://www.apple.com/appletv) in my house.  I do most of my reading on my iPad.  There is rarely a time when an Apple product isn't carried on my person or within arm's reach.  I live in a house constantly blanketed by a Wifi network powered by an Apple [Airport Extreme](http://www.apple.com/airportextreme) router.  Most people would call me an Apple "[fanboy](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fanboy)".

The story of how I ended up using Apple computers and the iPhone will be told another time but even after I became a "switcher", I still used [Google](http://www.google.com) for searching the web, [Gmail](http://mail.google.com) for sending, receiving, and storing email, [Google Docs](http://docs.google.com) for content creation and keeping notes, [Google Voice](https://www.google.com/voice) for internet phone calls, [Google Calendar](http://www.google.com/calendar) for tracking events and appointments, [Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader) for reading blogs and RSS feeds, [Google Analytics](www.google.com/analytics/) for tracking visitors to my websites, and [Google News](http://news.google.com) for finding out what's going on in the world.  I was 100% dependent on the Google ecosystem and recommended it to everyone.

### Customer or Product?

Over time I've stopped using almost everything that Google offers and the reason is that I realized that I'm not Google's customer - I'm Google's product.

It's a fundamental shift in thinking about Google.  With most software products in the world, the user of the software is the customer.  You would think that even with "free" software like Gmail, you're still a customer using a product in exchange for "payment", the payment being your permission to have ads displayed in the product and the attention you give to those ads.

However, the reality is that Google's product is actually you: your permission, attention, and the deep personal knowledge about you that Google derives from indexing your email content, documents, and tracking your use of Google software.  Google sells this product to its true customer: the advertiser.

When I realized this, I began to look at Google in a new light.  What I see is a once-revered technology leader making poor strategic investments and short-sighted tactical decisions.  Today's Google is not unlike a glamorous [Las Vegas hotel](http://www.bellagio.com) with its gleaming, romantic facade masking the creepy underlying reality of a business that requires the customer to lose slighly more often than they win.

The rest of this series will go over these shortcomings and consider how they will likely lead to the downfall of Google.

_My realization of the "customer vs. product" relationship is not new and has been nicely documented [here](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/03/29/961192/-You-re-Not-Google-s-Customer-You-re-the-Product) and [here](http://blog.sonicwebtech.com/2011/who-is-googles-real-customer/) if you are interested in a more in-depth discussion._




PART 2------------------------------------------------




Google's downfall will result from three fundamental business failures.  Failing in any one of these areas is enough to tank a successful business but when all three combine, you have the elements for a spectacular collapse.

This article discusses Google's flawed business model and how it is at odds with your right to privacy.

### Flawed Business Model: User Privacy = Worthless Users

As discussed in part one of this series, Google has only one valuable product to sell: you.  Through your use of Google's services, such as search and email, and by tracking which websites you visit, Google builds up a detailed profile of who you are:

{% blockquote Google http://support.google.com/mail/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=6603&topic=1668949&ctx=topic Ads in Gmail and your personal data %}
We are always looking for more ways to deliver you the most useful and relevant ads - for example, we may use your Google search queries on the Web, the sites you visit, Google Profile, +1â€™s and other Google Account information to show you more relevant ads in Gmail.
{% endblockquote %}

With this profile, it can predict what you want to buy, what you like to wear, what you like to eat, where you like to travel, and so on.  Google then works with advertisers who pay Google handsomely to put their ads in front of people who are most likely to buy or use their products and services.

On the face of it, this seems like a win for all parties.  Google provides services to you for free, advertisers optimize their expenditure of marketing budgets, and you, presumably, see ads which are primarily about products and services you are interested in.  This is a pretty cool idea and the basis business plan for many dotcom startups, not the least of which is Google's strongest competitor - Facebook.

The problem with this is related to privacy and the difference between implicit and explicit permission.  Facebook has a pretty detailed profile of who I am also.  For example, Facebook has a very good idea of what kind of movies I like.  This is because I have explicitly gone into Facebook and "liked" all of my favorite movies, movie stars, directors, etc.  I did this specifically to _share_ this information with my friends and I understand that by putting this information into Facebook that Facebook will probably use it for something.

However, I don't have control over what information shows up in my Gmail account.  Consider the supportive emails that friends may send someone with a recent diagnosis of prostate cancer.  Now Google knows that person has cancer.  It's not much of a stretch to imagine when this user goes into Google to search for "abdominal pain", he sees an ad for a local oncology center:

{% blockquote Google http://support.google.com/mail/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=1304609&topic=1668949&ctx=topic FAQ about Gmail, Security & Privacy %}
...automatic scanning and filtering technology is at the heart of Gmail. Gmail scans and processes all messages using fully automated systems in order to do useful and innovative stuff like filter spam, detect viruses and malware, show relevant ads, and develop and deliver new features across your Google experience.
{% endblockquote %}

The difference between Google and Facebook is that the information Facebook knows about me, I've _explicitly_ given to it.  The information Google knows about me I have little control over.  If you use any Google service or product or visit any website that uses Google Analytics, it's _implied_ that your usage will become part of your Google Profile - whether you like it or not.

A business built on selling this sort of product is at odd's with a user's desire for privacy and their legal right to privacy.  Privacy is like poison to a company like Google.  A user shrouded in privacy is worthless to Google because advertisers cannot target that user with precision.  If you don't know anything about that user, you wouldn't know to pitch them an Alaskan cruise or a Jamaican beach rental.  Advertisers won't pay any premiums for access to users like that and without those premiums, Google's revenue dries up quickly.

But better privacy laws are coming, despite Google's [substantial lobbying efforts](http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57419046-93/google-spends-record-$5-million-on-lobbying/).  Those laws will put a significant damper on Google's revenues and, right now, I'm not aware that they have other sizeable revenue source.

This is a continuation of my 8-part series discussing how Google's business practices and strategy could lead to Google's eventual demise.

This is part two.  You can read the [first part of this series here](http://www.charlessieg.com/blog/2012/09/16/the-demise-of-google-part-1/).



PART 3------------------------------------------------



In the preceding article, Google's flawed business model was discussed as one of three business failures that could lead to Google's eventual demise.  Before looking into the additional failures, how does Google's business model compare to other technology leaders and is it really possible for such a dominant company to find its "demise"?

Let's take a look at how Google's business model stacks up against some of its competitors.

<!--more--> 

The [freebie marketing business model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freebie_marketing) is used by several of Google's competitors, notably [Apple](http://www.apple.com) and [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com).  This business model, also known as the "razor and blades" model, became famous after the success of [King Gillette](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Camp_Gillette), the inventor of the disposable safety razor, in the early 1900s.  In Gillette's implementation of the model, a durable razor was essentially "given away", with assured future profits from owners coming back to buy more blades for the razor.

{% blockquote King Camp Gillette, Founder of The Gillette Company %}
Give 'em the razor; sell 'em the blades!
{% endblockquote %}

### Freebie Marketing by Technology Firms

Technology companies have often used freebie marketing.  Printer manufacturers often sell a printer at cost in order to assure future sales of ink and toner cartridges.  The original Atari 2600 was sold at cost, relying on future game sales for profit.

#### Apple

Apple has a unique variation of the freebie business model.  Apple is a hardware manufacturer.  It does make and sell other products but its core profit engine is hardware: Macintosh computers, iPhones, iPads, and iPods of various sizes.

Apple also makes a very powerful, elegant, secure, and robust operating system called Mac OS X.  It makes other Mac software called iWork, iLife, and iTunes, and a similar set of apps for iOS devices.  Most of these are free and those that cost are very inexpensive.

The purpose of all of this software?  To sell the hardware.  Apple's razor (freebie) is the software and the blades are the computers and iDevices that people buy every 2-3 years.

There is no doubt that the Apple hardware is powerful and beautiful but people buy hardware for what they can do with it: web browsing, email, word processing, spreadsheets, photo editing, and so on.  Apple makes sure that all of these tasks can be done with free or reasonably priced software designed to run perfectly on Apple hardware.   

#### Amazon

Amazon sells many things but books are, and always have been, their focus.  The future of books is eBooks and Amazon wants everyone to buy their eBooks from Amazon.  To this end, Amazon created the Kindle.  Amazon has always sold the Kindle close to its cost (and sometimes at a loss).  Amazon doesn't care about making money from the Kindle.  Amazon wants to make money from all of the eBooks you'll buy to read on your Kindle.  Amazon doesn't even care if you read its eBooks on the Kindle.  You can read your eBooks on your iPhone, iPad, Mac, Windows PC, web browser, or Android device, as long as you use the free Kindle software.

#### And Google?

Google, however, implements a somewhat twisted variation of the freebie business model.

What does Google give away?  It gives you free (mediocre) software.  It gives you free email, free web search, free calendar, free everything.  As a user, in general, you do not have to pay Google anything to use their software.

So what do they sell?  The sell you.

So they give away free software to gain users who they then profile and package off to their true customer, the advertiser.

The problem with this model is that the receiver of the razor and the buyer of the blades are not the same.

Usually the razor user can't get any benefit from his razor unless he buys his blades.  He doesn't buy a new razor because he already has blades to use.  No such thing here - nothing keeping the razor user using the razo.  The razor is fickle.  He doesn't have to buy blades.  In fact, he never has to buy anything.  The razor must constantly improve or that is it.

This is a continuation of my 8-part series discussing how Google's business practices and strategy could lead to Google's eventual demise.

This is part three.  You can also read [part one](http://www.charlessieg.com/blog/2012/09/16/the-demise-of-google-part-1/) and [part two](http://www.charlessieg.com/blog/2012/09/17/the-demise-of-google-part-2/).


















### Bad Company

The dramatic rise and fall of technology companies is fairly common.  There are many examples of dominant companies falling into the abyss.

Research In Motion (RIMM).

Palm.

Lycos, AltaVista, Yahoo, etc.



### The sins of Google

Poor Leadership, Wrong CEO

Loss of Focus and Poor Execution


### Android is toast

Android, as we know it, is going to disappear.

Litigation risk.
Fragmentation.
Lack of vendor control.
At Google's mercy.

### A worthy competitor

Facebook will hasten Google's doom.  Companies turn on their leadership and Google's leadership sucks while Zuckerberg is the next Steve Jobs and Bill Gates rolled into one.

### An alternate reality

It wasn't always this way between Google and Apple.  Eric Schmidt used to be on Apple's Board of Directors.  They were a trusted, valued partner.

### What could save Google?

Google invests in many different technologies unrelated to search.  For example, Google has the most accurate dynamic translation engine in Google Translate.  Google has invented  a car which can drive itself, having driven over 100,000 miles without incident.
