[From TechCrunch](http://tcrn.ch/JetNMT) this morning:



> Itâ€™s a time when startups are competing against Google and Facebook offers of $150,000 in base salary for fresh computer science graduates.



That's for the n00bs.  Consultants and designers are getting $150 - $225 an hour.

It's a good time to be in tech.
