Saw [this article](http://www.careercast.com/jobs-rated/2012-ranking-200-jobs-best-worst) recently.  Computer Science-related jobs are doing well with Software Engineer as the #1 job, Computer Systems Analyst as #9, and Web Developer as #15.

Healthcare and wellness-related jobs dominate the top 20 with:

* \#4 Dental Hygienist

* \#6 Audiologist

* \#7 Occupational Therapist

* \#11 Speech Pathologist

* \#12 Optometrist

* \#13 Physical Therapist

* \#14 Pharmacist

* \#17 Dietitian

and

* \#19 Chiropractor

And good news if you like math as Actuary is #2, Mathematician #10, and Statistician at #18.

So, basically it is a great time if you like to help keep or make people healthy or are an über nerd like me.
