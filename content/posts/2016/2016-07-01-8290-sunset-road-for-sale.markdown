The house I grew up in is now for sale. Before my parents moved out, I bought a Phantom 4 drone and captured around 3 hours of aerial video. I edited it down to a 2+ minute video highlighting the house, amenities, and landscape. I was planning to use Adobe After Effects but was able to do everything I needed in iMovie.
