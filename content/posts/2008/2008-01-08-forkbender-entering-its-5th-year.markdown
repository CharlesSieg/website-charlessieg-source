I started ForkBender.com with a first post on May 27, 2003. The software I use to maintain this blog is called Exposition (which sits on a CMS I wrote called Narrative). This software dates back to February, 2003. So in the next few months, I will have had Narrative and Exposition in production for 5 years! The software now powers almost a dozen websites and contains a couple of thousand posts and images. I took most of last year off to move and do other things but I am working on the software again and am looking to post more often as well. Here's to 2008!
