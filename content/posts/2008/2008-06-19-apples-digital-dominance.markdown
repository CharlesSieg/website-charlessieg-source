Apple reported today two little items of interest:
	
  * They are getting [a subsidy of $325 per iPhone](http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/08/06/19/att_paying_apple_325_subsidy_on_every_iphone_3g_sold_report.html) from AT&T.  This is a premium of approximately $125 over what is normally paid for a phone by a telco.

	
  * The also [sold their 5 billionth song and are now serving up 50,000 movies per day](http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/08/06/19/itunes_store_sells_5_billionth_song_serving_50000_movies_per_day.html).  That makes them the #1 online music store and the #1 online MOVIE store!


Add this into the mix with the iPhone 3G going into 72 countries, the massive improvements in Mac OS X, and the huge numbers of new Mac owners, and it is easy to see that 2008 is going to be an amazing year for Apple.  They are certainly demonstrating momentum unlike any company since Microsoft in its early days (think Microsoft Windows driving Microsoft Office sales, etc.).

I'm looking for Apple to extend its reach into other content, particularly news and books.  How much longer before we see digital newspaper and magazine subscriptions through iTunes?  How much longer before a digital device for reading that beats the Kindle?  People will always need news and people will always read books.  Everything will be digital soon so why not Apple for these types of content as well?
