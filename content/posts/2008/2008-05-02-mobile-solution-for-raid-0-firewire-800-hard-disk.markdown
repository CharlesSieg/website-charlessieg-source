Turns out LaCie makes an excellent portable FireWire bus-powered 7200 rpm hard disk which implements a RAID 0 solution.  The [LaCie Little Big Disk Quadra](http://www.lacie.com/products/product.htm?pid=11037) does it all.  This, my friends, is the ultimate drive for running a VM from an external drive to a MacBook Pro.  It's 7200 rpm, RAID 0, FireWire 800 and has 400 GB of total storage space.  Perfect.
