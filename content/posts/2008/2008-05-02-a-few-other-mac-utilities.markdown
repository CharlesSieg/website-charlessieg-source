I remembered a couple of other Mac programs I use pretty regularly.  Add these to [my other list of Mac software](http://www.charlessieg.com/?p=21):

[XBench](http://www.xbench.com/).  This is the standard Mac benchmarking program.  It's freeware and it rocks.  It will benchmark your Mac's CPU, memory, graphics card, and disks.

[Remote Desktop](http://www.microsoft.com/mac/products/remote-desktop/default.mspx).  The only Microsoft offering I use on the Mac, RD is essential if you need to remote into a Windows machine somewhere.  This is great if you are a Window developer (at least some of the time) and need to get into your servers and don't want to boot up the Windows VM or reboot into Boot Camp.
