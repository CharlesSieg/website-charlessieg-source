title: A Recap on My WWDC Predictions
tags:

I [made a bunch of predictions yesterday](http://www.charlessieg.com/?p=38) about what would be announced today at the WWDC keynote.  Here are the ones I got right:
	
* 3G

* GPS

* The App Store will not be ready on Day 1 (meaning today).

* Thinner design.

* A normal headphone jack.

* Increased battery life.

* New colors...I was thinking red, but for some ungodly reason they went with white...LOLWUT?

Several are as yet unknown:

	
  * Tethering.  This was not mentioned in the keynote and I can't find any posts to confirm it and the Apple website does not seem to mention it.  If the phone does not tether, a lot of people are going to be disappointed, and possibly more will be actually pissed.

	
  * Full A2DP support.  Not mentioned, although they did say the audio support was significantly improved.  We'll see.

	
  * iPhone as remote.  Still possible through an application from the App Store but no official offering from Apple, as far as I know.


A few things were totally off:

	
  * Front and rear facing video camera.  Totally false.  No video camera, period.  The iPhone continues to be the only modern mobile phone that completely lacks a video capture feature.

	
  * More memory.  Apparently, no one needs more memory.  The two models offered are still the 8 GB and the 16 GB models.

	
  * Flash on the iPhone.  Problematic still because of the lack of memory?  Not sure on that.

	
  * OLED display.  No mention.  Zero.  Total fantasy of mine.
