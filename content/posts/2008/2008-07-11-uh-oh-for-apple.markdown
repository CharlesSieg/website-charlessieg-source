Well, the big news outlets haven't picked up on it yet but new (and existing) phone activations are completely and totally hosed up.  Every store in every country and every user at home is getting the same experience: no go on activation.  Apple maybe should have consulted with the guys who put on the Victoria's Secret Superbowl half time runway show about how to handle massive spikes in traffic.  Too late...gonna be a lot of unhappy people.
