title: Switchgrass Coming on Strong

I am a big proponent of finding a viable biofuel alternative to oil for energy in the United States. Ethanol is a good choice but it's been a question whether or not it would be profitable and cost-effective. A new paper published today in the Proceedings of Natural Sciences clears that all up. Turns out that switchgrass produces 540% more energy than is required to grow it and turn it into ethanol. This should [clear the way](http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2008/107/1?rss=1) for large-scale conversion of marginal farmland into switchgrass crops.
