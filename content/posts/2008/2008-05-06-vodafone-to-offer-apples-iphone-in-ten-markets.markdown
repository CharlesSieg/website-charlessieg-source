[Vodafone to Offer Apple’s iPhone in Ten Markets](http://www.vodafone.com/start/media_relations/news/group_press_releases/2007/vodafone_to_offer0.html): "

On the newswire today:


> Vodafone today announced it has signed an agreement with Apple to sell the iPhone in ten of its markets around the globe. Later this year, Vodafone customers in Australia, the Czech Republic, Egypt, Greece, Italy, India, Portugal, New Zealand, South Africa and Turkey will be able to purchase the iPhone for use on the Vodafone network.


Best press release I’ve seen in years. 56 words, short and to the point. No mention of exclusivity, so [there’s speculation](http://www.itwire.com/content/view/17998/1151/) that other carriers will have the iPhone in these markets, too.
