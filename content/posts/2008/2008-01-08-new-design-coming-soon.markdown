I have not even been to my own website in over 6 months. Now that I've seen it, I don't like the design anymore. I dislike the font and everything looks a little too red, white, and blue. I'm quite the patriotic dude but I don't feel the need to splash the national colors on my website. Hence, I will be coming up with a new stylesheet soon.




Apparently, the comments are not working right now, either. So I'll fix that also.
