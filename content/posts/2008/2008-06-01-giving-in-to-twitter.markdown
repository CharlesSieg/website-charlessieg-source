I have been resisting the urge to spend any time using [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com).  However, I have recently conceived of a few areas of my life where it might be interesting to do some real-time micro-posting.  So I'll be testing out the service over the next couple of weeks.  In particular, I am aiming to do some real-time posting from the WWDC next week.  I'll be arriving in San Fran on Sunday, leaving on Friday.  With all of the recent performance and scalability issues Twitter has been having lately, it will be telling whether or not they can handle what I expect to be significant load during the Jobs keynote on the 9th.  Anyway, more details inbound...
