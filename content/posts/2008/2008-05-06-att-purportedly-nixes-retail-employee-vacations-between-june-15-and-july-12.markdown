[AT&T Purportedly Nixes Retail Employee Vacations Between June 15 and July 12](http://www.boygeniusreport.com/2008/05/06/apple-and-att-to-launch-iphone-3g-a-lot-sooner-than-we-think/): "

Leaked memo states they wish to ensure sufficient staffing for ‘an exciting Summer Promotional Launch.’ They did the same thing last year for the original iPhone debut.

So, question: Will there be tens of thousands of people across the country lined up all day waiting to buy the new iPhones, just like last year? I say yes.
