CharlesSieg.com has finally taken the plunge and moved on to a "modern" blogging platform.  Prior to today, the website was hosted in Narrative, a blogging platform designed, written, and supported by me.  That is, until the last year has been so busy that there hasn't been any support.  So, hence, the move to WordPress, the #1 blogging platform in the world.  I'm already enjoying the great post editing support and the many beautiful themes.  I should be posting more often now.
