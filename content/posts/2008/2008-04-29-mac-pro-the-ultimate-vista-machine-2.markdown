I find it ironic in the extreme that probably the best Windows computer in the world is Apple's [Mac Pro](http://www.apple.com/macpro/) workstation.  For $2,799 base, you get (2) Intel 64-bit Xeon CPUs, each with 4 cores, 8 memory slots expandable to 32 GB total memory with 2 GB installed, and a bunch of other stuff.

We bought one for [Ahu](http://www.ahusieg.com) to use at home to help speed along her [dissertation experiments](http://research.ahusieg.com).  Ahu works with massive XML files and those files, when read in, take up lots of memory.

We got the computer and I ordered and installed a total of 14 GB of memory.  Mac OS X is already a 64-bit OS so it recognized the 14 GB of memory immediately, with the performance bump to show for it.  After booting up in Mac OS X, I created a 100 GB partition for Boot Camp.  I rebooted and installed 64-bit Windows Vista Ultimate and then the Boot Camp drivers.  Everything installed flawlessly and within another hour I had Visual Studio 2008, SQL Server 2005, and associated utility applications all installed.

So she's running dual quad-core Xeons with 14 GB.  All that for about the price of my [MacBook Pro](http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/) notebook, fully loaded.

But that Mac Pro workstation is a screamer.  In early performance testing, the MSBuild compile time of the .NET projects at work dropped from about 35 seconds on my MacBook to 7 seconds on the Mac Pro.  More importantly, Ahu's experiments, which took hours before, now take only a few minutes.  The amount of time saved over the next 6 months will more than pay for this luxurious desktop supercomputer.
