After yesterday's announcement of the new Apple iTunes movie rental service, the stock of Blockbuster tanked 17%.  The end is near for those ubiquitous blue and gold stores.  Personally, I loathe Blockbuster.  Looking for a movie at Blockbuster is right up there with standing in line at airport security in terms of fun for me.  I tried out the iTunes movie rentals last night.  It took a few minutes to actually find any rentable movies (only 1,000 titles were available on day 1) but after I figured it out, it was trivial.  I already canceled my Netflix subscription.  Their stock dropped almost 4%.  I'm also probably going to go buy an Apple TV tonight as well.  That little device has finally become a compelling purchase.  Awesome stuff, Apple!
