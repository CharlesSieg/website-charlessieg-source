All of my websites are in the process of migrating away from my homegrown blogging software - Exposition / Narrative / Rendition - in favor of the latest version of WordPress.  The reason?  Simply put, I am much more interested in blogging than the building of blogging software.  I originally created Narrative because there wasn't a good blogging package for ASP.NET.  Now, almost 6 years later, while I still work as a .NET architect, I spend all of my time on a Mac, which means I have access to a LAMP stack, etc.  Anyway, you'll see a lot of changes here due to the conversion, the first of which is that comments are now open on all posts going forward.
