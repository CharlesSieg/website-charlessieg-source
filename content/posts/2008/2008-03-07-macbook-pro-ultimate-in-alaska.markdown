I ordered a new MacBook Pro last week, the day the new hardware refresh was released.  Actually, I spent a bunch of time running around to Apple stores to see if anyone had one in stock but no one did so I had to order mine custom from the Apple store.

The computer left Shanghai, China on the 6th and arrived in Anchorage, Alaska today.  According to the FedEx tracking system, it has already left Alaska and is en route to me.  This is my second MacBook Pro and a significant upgrade to the one I have now.  The new one has the following:



	
  * 4 GB of memory (2 GB plus 2 GB I have waiting here on my desk to install as soon as it arrives)

	
  * 512 MB nVidia 8600m GT graphics card (2x as much video memory and a faster card)

	
  * 200 GB 7200 rpm hard disk (50% faster than the one I have and almost 100 GB more storage)

	
  * 1920x1200 LED display (less power consumption bumps battery life to 5 hours with 20% more pixels)

	
  * 802.11n networking (to take advantage of my Airport Extreme)

	
  * 2.6 GHz Intel Core Duo 2 processor (75% faster than what I have now)


and...the new multitouch trackpad for all of the new gestures.  I use the existing gestures constantly so I am looking forward to the additional productivity.
