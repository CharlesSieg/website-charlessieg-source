ForkBender.com now has a new search box! The Narrative CMS now has search capabilities and ForkBender.com is the beta test site. When you type in a word like "powerlifting" or "golf" in the search box at the top of the right-hand column and press ENTER or click "Search", a search results page will appear. This functionality will be changing (read: improving) a lot in the next few weeks. Let me know if you run into any issues.
