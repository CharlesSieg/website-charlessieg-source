  * Wow, AT&T; is making progress with its [Natural Voices products](http://nextup.com/nvgames.html). Now you can hear your computer read to you with voices in British, French, German, Latin American, and Indian accents!


  * FiveStarFinds.com has a link to [a really cool popcorn vendor](http://www.fivestarfinds.com/content/4d2b82fa3f284cb99b3919e4b17db43e.htm). We're ordering several flavors to try when the family is together over Christmas. My vote was for Tutti Frutti!


  * Google has [Ten Golden Rules](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10296177/site/newsweek/) for optimizing your knowledge workers. Greaaat.


  * I knew that sooner or later someone would publish these online. [The 48 Laws of Power](http://www2.tech.purdue.edu/cgt/courses/cgt411/covey/48_laws_of_power.htm) are not to be toyed with. Better to [buy the book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140280197/forkbendercom-20/104-1909208-5649565?%5Fencoding=UTF8&camp=1789&link%5Fcode=xm2) and get the full advice.


  * A cool guide to using fotoplop to [colorize a black and white photo](http://www.devlobby.com/forums/showthread.php?p=599).


  * [How to make knots](http://www.iwillknot.com/)...for those who don't know how to sail. Heh.
