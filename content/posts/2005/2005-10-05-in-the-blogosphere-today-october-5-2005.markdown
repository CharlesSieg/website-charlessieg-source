  * Great source for [plyometric jump boxes](http://www.jumpusa.com/jump_boxes.html). Am thinkin' maybe I get summa dat.


  * All the [poison ivy pictures](http://poisonivy.aesir.com/view/pictures.html#105) you could ever need or want to see. Based on the pictures that readers have submitted of their rashes, I am now fairly certain that my poison ivy rash of 1989 was the worst case of poison ivy in history.


  * Huh, this would have made for [an interesting Tonight Show](http://www.thesuperficial.com/archives/dane_cook_kiss_charlize_ass.jpg) with Jay Leno.
