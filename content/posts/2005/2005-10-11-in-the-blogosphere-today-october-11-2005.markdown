  * [Verizon's new FiOS](http://www.i4u.com/article4365.html), or fiber-to-the-home network, delivers 30 MB connectivity. Can't wait 'til this is offered in my neighborhood.

	
  * A [very cool wooden case](http://www.iwoodnano.com/miniot/index.htm) for your non-scratch-proof Nano.

	
  * [Muhammad Ali's house is for sale](http://luxuryrealestate.com/scripts/index.php?siteScript=propPages&siteScreen=details&propCurrID=121130). Don't miss the regulation boxing ring.

	
  * I wonder how the real estate agent lucked into [this one](http://cbba.com/PropertyDetail.aspx?GroupID=3192644&Sort=0&ListingID=8050386&P=1&SPID=0)? This is living in your own hotel.

	
  * Bad timing on [this sign for Dairy Queen's Earthquake dessert](http://www.moleskinerie.com/2005/10/disastrous_sign.html). Probably not a good idea, in general, to name your food after types of disaster.

	
  * China treats [Internet addicts with bizarre headgear](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4327258.stm). See picture 2.
