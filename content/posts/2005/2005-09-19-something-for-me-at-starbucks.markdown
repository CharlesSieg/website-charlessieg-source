I finally found something coffee-ish I like to drink at Starbuck's. As some know, I don't drink any type of coffee. Have always hated it. The only foods I like which are coffee-flavored are the Jamocha Shake at [Arby's](http://www.arbys.com) and Jamocha ice cream from Baskin-Robbins. I had always avoided Starbucks because I always avoid coffee. This weekend, though, my wife suggested I try a frappuccino and to much delight, I found it's just a Jamocha Shake. Ha! I know someone at Starbucks Galactic Headquarters is freaking out being compared to a Jamocha Shake at that lowborn Arby's super-franchise wannabe, but that's what it tastes like to me. The frappuccino is slightly more coffee-tasting but not so much more so that I don't like it. It was really a tasty pick-me-up. Avoid the whipped cream topping, however - the Grande frappuccino is [260 calories](http://www.calorie-count.com/calories/item/57183.html) already. In full disclosure, I actually had a Tall ["Mint Mocha Chip"](http://www.starbucks.com/retail/nutrition_beverage_detail.asp?selProducts=181) frappuccino. To be fair, a medium Arby's Jamocha Shake as [500 calories](http://arbys.com/nutrition/Arbys_US_Nutrition.pdf) so a frappuccino is of marginally better nutritive value.
