Ah, Slashdot... Someone posted images from the new Star Wars movie last week. There were about 80 images leaked in total covering every major scene in the movie: The Revenge of the Sith.




The images were as revealing as could be. Every event of significance in the movie was covered by at least one scene. Even the finale which contains a lightsaber duel between Anakin and Obi-Wan is available for review.




George Lucas must have a hit squad out looking for the guy who leaked these images. The whole story has been revealed. I don't recommend following this link if you want any sort of surprise when you see the movie: [http://www.tpu.fi/~t4jlaaks/ep3/](http://www.tpu.fi/~t4jlaaks/ep3/)




UPDATE: That link seems to be overloaded and / or taken down. As I said before, George Lucas has got to be a little bit ticked about the leak and will be working vigorously to take down all websites with the spoiler images.




UPDATE 2: A new link: [http://www.chinese-starwars.com/starwarsepisode3/moviescene/episode3scene.htm](http://www.chinese-starwars.com/starwarsepisode3/moviescene/episode3scene.htm)
