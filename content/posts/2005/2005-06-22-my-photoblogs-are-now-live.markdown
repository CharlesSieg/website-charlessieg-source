I recently became a [Flickr Pro](http://www.flickr.com) member and am now using their excellent photo gallery service for my photo blogs [RandomSnapshot.com](http://www.randomsnapshot.com) and [FearlessPhotos.com](http://www.fearlessphotos.com). The DNS entries are updating now. If the links don't work, you can also go [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/62864711@N00/).

I may eventually move all of my image galleries to Flickr as it is really a great way to store and show photos online. The main features I like are the ability to give each photo a title and description, as well as the ability for others to leave comments about the photos. There is even a neat little feature which allows a user to annotate a _part_ of a picture to draw attention to some detail.

The photos I have posted here so far are all taken by my camera phone. I have a Toshiba phone and Sprint PCS Vision. When I take a photo I simply email it to a private Flickr email address to post it online. The phone has this capability built-in so taking a photo and posting it online is a matter of about 30 seconds.

The [Pro](http://www.flickr.com/upgrade/) service is $24.95 per year but is well worth the price given the many features it provides. Highly recommended.
