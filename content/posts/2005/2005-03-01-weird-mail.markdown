I recently received a strange letter in the mail. I haven't actually opened it as it was not addressed to me. In fact, the address is the weird part of the letter:  

  

Mr. and Mrs. So and So  

641 Huntington Ridge Blvd  

Somewhere in, FL 30xxx  

  

Now I live at 641 Huntington Blvd in West Dundee in Illinois. So how could this possibly have come to me??? Last time I checked, the ZIP code was the really important part of the address when deciding how to route a piece of mail at the national level.
