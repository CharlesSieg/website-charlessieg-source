  * [Fantastic article on the biology of sleep](http://www.supermemo.com/articles/sleep.htm#Siesta%20and%20catnapping), napping, effects of certain foods and drugs on sleep, etc. Could be the best article I've ever read on this topic. Some other interesting articles about sleep and waking up refreshed [here](http://glenrhodes.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=54&Itemid=9) and [here](http://veenix.blogspot.com/2005/10/alarm-clocks-are-bad-how-to-wake-up.html).

	
  * Pretty neat [optical illusion here](http://www.patmedia.net/marklevinson/cool/cool_illusion.html). Worked for me on the first try.

	
  * [This house](http://tours3.vht.com/vt/STD/virtualtour.aspx?ListingID=1041787) is exactly what I would expect someone to build in Las Vegas. Huge, sparkly, and essentially, very, very tacky...just like the realtors.

	
  * Finally, someone puts [a personal helicopter](http://www.gen-corp.jp/) into production. This little guy goes 80 mph.

	
  * Ah...and the [hilarious snow cartoons of Calvin & Hobbes](http://www.angelfire.com/wa/zzaran/calvin.html). Highly recommended.
