  * Cool Flickr gallery of [images taken by cameras tossed into the air](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/cameratoss/interesting/)! Futuristic spirals and waves, oh my!


  * A very slick list of [made-up words from the Simpsons show](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Made-up_words_in_The_Simpsons). Sacrilicious!


  * In the spirit of the upcoming holiday - the [everything-you-need-to-know website on carving your pumpkin](http://www.pumpkin-carving.com/) for Halloween!


  * [Interesting timeline of video games history](http://www.worldhistory.com/wiki/T/Timeline-of-video-games.htm). Who knew that both Sega and Nintendo were around before the 1960s?
