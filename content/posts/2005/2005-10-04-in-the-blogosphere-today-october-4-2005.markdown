Not much today, I'm afraid...






  * Great photoblog [here](http://www.bigempty.com/archive/000291.html). Some really nice landscape shots.


  * Cool online magazine called [Make ](http://makezine.com/)which is dedicated to hardware hacks, digital projects, and DIY inspiration.


  * Excellent! Peter Jackson, director of the Lord of the Rings trilogy and Kong, has been [named to run the production](http://today.reuters.com/news/newsArticleSearch.aspx?storyID=200859+04-Oct-2005+RTRS&srch=halo) of the Halo movie.
