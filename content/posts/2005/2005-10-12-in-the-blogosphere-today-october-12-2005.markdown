  * Money Magazine has a list of [](http://moneycentral.msn.com/content/savinganddebt/finddealsonline/p92985.asp)10 things you should never buy new. Another related article called ["Why First-rate Folks Like Secondhand Stuff"](http://moneycentral.msn.com/content/SavingandDebt/P46314.asp).

	
  * Very intriguing [sculpture made of 14,000 carboard boxes](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/4326462.stm).

	
  * The [Video iPod](http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000373063047/) is now out. The black one is the new shiznit. Too bad about the screen width, though. 16:9 wide screen would have been better.

	
  * [Where the missing weapons of mass destruction went.](http://geekswithblogs.net/scottkuhl/archive/2005/10/12/GargamelMakesGoodonThreats.aspx)

	
  * Oh, man, can't wait: screen shots from [Project Gotham Racing 3](http://media.xbox360.ign.com/media/741/741362/imgs_1.html) for the Xbox 360. Due on launch day in November. [Movies](http://media.xbox360.ign.com/media/741/741362/vids_1.html), too.
