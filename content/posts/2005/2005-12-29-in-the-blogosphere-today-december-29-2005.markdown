  * There's going to be at least [one hourly employee getting a pink slip](http://www.komotv.com/stories/40979.htm) shortly...and hopefully a long prison sentence.


  * Some interesting [home movies made in-game with World of Warcraft](http://www.warcraftmovies.com)...someone has a lot of time to kill - and that's in addition to the hundred-hour game commitment.


  * At long last, a math geek has quantified [the answer to "Do you get less wet running in the rain](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4562132.stm) as opposed to walking in the rain?"


  * How to [find a double-feature at your local movie theater](http://doublefeaturefinder.com/) - brilliant!


  * Apparently [Naples, Florida has a Luxury Homes Tour](http://www.napleshometour.com/2005/index.html) also. Much different than the Tour in Chicago this year.


  * [Bananas are truly the superfood](http://www.finetuneyou.com/Bananas.html)! Do you need to eat anything other than these?


  * Why a ["bespoke" suit is truly the world's best suit](http://www.englishcut.com/archives/000004.html) - perhaps one day I'll be able to afford such a fine-fitting luxury.


  * The [History of the Universe in 200 Words or Less](http://members.bellatlantic.net/~vze3fs8i/hist/hist.html). Quite complete, really.


  * A [lengthy and excellent rant](http://www.bynkii.com/archives/2005/05/i_hates_lucas_i.html) on the work of George Lucas.
