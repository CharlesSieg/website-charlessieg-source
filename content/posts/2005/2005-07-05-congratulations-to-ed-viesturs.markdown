Mountaineer Ed Viesturs became the first American to summit all 8,000+ meter peaks in the world without supplemental oxygen. It's taken 16 years but he finally pulled it off. Annapurna was his last peak, one that has taken him three attempts to conquer. There's a great story on this in the August 2005 issue of Men's Journal magazine.
