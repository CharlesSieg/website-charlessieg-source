  * Really interesting article on [how Apple succeeds in continually delivering the coolest stuff](http://www.timecanada.com/story.adp?storyid=005&part=1&area=) on Earth.


  * This house has [a really, really big yard](http://www.savills.co.uk/residentialSearch/fbf5da98-818b-4c45-a8c5-b018a7411760-6-3-3-clickThumbnailSubmit/residentialSearch/propertyDetail.aspx?AlchemyID=340095&pID=103845).

  * To me, this looks like [the world's most expensive baby chair...for adults](http://www.asobi.si/isle/view01.html) at only $52,000 per.


  * Pretty [nice mansion in Canada - $13,500,000](http://www.goodalemillergroup.com/listingdetails.asp?id=53). I especially like the deck.


  * If you ever wanted to see a business presentation done the right way, take a look at [Steve Jobs' introducing the new video iPod](http://stream.apple.akadns.net/). This is a man in his element.


  * This is the house that La Tour built: [Lance Armstrong's house is on the market](http://www.cordshomes.com/detailedlisting.php?listingid=63). Great driveway, great pool, awesome living room. Wow. Lots of great windows and light.
