  * This [website](http://www.watercolorwalls.com/index.cfm) offers some inexpensive and attractive solutions for faux painting. I'm planning on ordering a kit to try it out.


  * Really [big Ziploc bags](http://www.ziploc.com/big-bags/). Really, big.


  * This [bridge](http://bridgepros.com/projects/Millau_Viaduct/) is very high. Good pictures [here](http://www.viaducdemillau.com/). Crazy French people.


  * Not quite so stunning without furniture but [this house in Hollywood Hills](http://www.discovervillafiona.com/) has some amazing walls.


  * This [little device](http://www.x-tremegeek.com/templates/searchdetail.asp?T1=121+2535) adds a bit of clutter but frees up space on your power strip. I gotta get me summa dat.


  * Send your future self an [email](http://futureme.org/).
