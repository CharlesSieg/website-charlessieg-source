  * Backup your Flickr photos [here](http://sunkencity.org/flickrbackup/). Just in time...I was wondering how I might get my camera phone pictures off of Flickr.


  * Kind of creepy but apparently you can search through millions of cemetery records online at [FindAGrave.com](http://www.findagrave.com/).


  * Now if only I had [$7.5 million](http://www.villaromanza.info/)...


  * This [film site](http://www.bmwfilms.com/clap.asp?template=international&country=&film=) is probably one of the reasons I like BMW so much.


  * I would really much rather work in an environment that looks like [this](http://mocoloco.com/archives/001498.php).


  * Great design [idea](http://mocoloco.com/archives/100_2_emco.jpg) for hiding certain mudane bathroom items.


  * Now [this](http://mrjarchitects.com/MRJArchitects%20Canyon%203.htm) will be really, really cool. A glass walkway 4,000 over the Grand Canyon.


  * The [ScreenGrab Firefox extension](http://andy.5263.org/screengrab) saves whole, scrolling web documents from top to bottom as PNG files to your computer. Requires a recent version of Java.
