  * Saw this yesterday and forgot to post it. Some woman in [Arkansas has given birth to her 16th child](http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/10/12/national/main938703.shtml). Seems a little excessive to me. How do you save for their college education, for example? Oh, never mind, it's Arkansas.


  * Ha! Is it just me or is there [something very wrong about the logo for "NimbleText"](http://jr.nimbletext.com/)?


  * [Scientists finally synthesize insect resilin](http://www.smh.com.au/news/science/fleas-leap-for-mankind/2005/10/12/1128796590054.html?oneclick=true). Possible uses include artificial arteries and spinal bones as well as shoes which allow humans to jump hundreds of feet in the air. Air Sieg, coming up!


  * Ever wanted to see what it's like to [drive a Porsche 170 mph on the Autobahn](http://theradblog.typepad.com/theradblog/2005/10/autobahn_videob.html)? Watch this awesome video. Definitely something to put on the To Do list.


  * An [interesting German "hotel" with minimalist rooms](http://www.dasparkhotel.net/). You won't catch me staying in one of these - someone might roll you away...


  * Hmmm...an interesting "kit" of [small toolish items for an emergency trip](http://www.escapemyhead.com/2005/10/tttk-travel-tinker-trouble-kit.html) that happen to fit in an Altoids canister.
