  * Instead of having his car stolen, a man who left his doors unlocked at a commuter train parking lot [receives a diamond ring](http://www.thebostonchannel.com/news/5540637/detail.html). Craziness!


  * Say hello to the beautiful blue Caribbean waters at [the new Ritz-Carlton Grand Cayman](http://www.ritzcarlton.com/resorts/grand_cayman/default.html). Put this one on the must-visit list.


  * I could move to Florida if I could live in this house. [Belcastello in Sarasota is going for $13.5M](http://www.michaelsaunders.com/cntrl/ResidentialDetail/ListingID/292439/OrgID/sara.aspx). I particularly like the master bedroom and the pool view. Unfortunately, though, it is in Sarasota, also known as "God's Waiting Room" because of the older crowd.


  * Interesting article on [how much designers should charge hourly](http://www.jdempsey.com/2005/12/14/designers-how-much-to-charge/) for their work. Personally, I think the rates listed in the article are a bit low.


  * This is [a cool little time waster: Escapa](http://www.iol.ie/~dluby/escape.htm)! My personal best after about 20 tries is 18.26 seconds.


  * The Swiss have some strange ideas about designing currency. [Take a look at the 200](http://giussani.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/newswissbanknotes_1.jpg) - that's a 3D rendering of the AIDS virus.


  * [Awesome trailer](http://www.apple.com/trailers/fox/x3/large.html) for the new X-Men movie! Nice sound track and excellent visuals...but what do you expect? It's X-Men!!!
