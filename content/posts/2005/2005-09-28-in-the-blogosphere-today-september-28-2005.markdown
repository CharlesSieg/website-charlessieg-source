  * Giant squids [exist](http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,170632,00.html). Hope you never get in this guy's way.


  * DIY [flooring](http://www.interfaceflor.com/service/flor/design.html). Nice.


  * [Fast track](http://www.slackermanager.com/slacker_manager/2005/09/fast_track_your.html) yourself. How to manage your upwardly mobile career. Not that this applies to those of us who own the company they work for.


  * Excellent website statistics from [StatCounter.com](http://www.statcounter.com). ForkBender uses this - only $9 per month.


  * How to beat procrastination with a "[dash](http://www.43folders.com/2005/09/kick_procrastin_1.html)".


  * Robot finds [largest treasure hoard](http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,1578135,00.html) ever. Man, that shoulda been me. I missed my calling. @#$@#!!!


  * Golf at [night](http://www.luxist.com/entry/1234000300060705/)? That'd be fun - not. My idea of fun is not hunting around in the rough looking for a golf ball during nocturnal animals' busy time. Sure fire way to get a big owie.


  * The [Energy Blue](http://www.download.com/Energy-Blue-theme-for-WinXP/3000-2325-10403283.html?tag=nl.e415) theme from Vista works on Windows XP also. Kinda cool. What's with all the lens flares, though?


  * Really cool book [Small Houses](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/3822841765/qid%3D1127652420/sr%3D1-1/ref%3Dsr%5F1%5F1/002-2145035-2432812?v=glance&s=books) on Amazon, via [MocoLoco](http://mocoloco.com/archives/001495.php).
