The server hosting this website has moved. It used to be hosted at [ServerBeach](http://www.serverbeach.com) and I was paying about $120 a month for a dedicated server there. I got kind of tired of that and so I set up a dedicated server in the basement of my house. The server running this site is now more powerful than the old one but the upload speed of my home network connection is only around 384 K so the site might seem slower to you. If so, too bad, I'm saving $1000+ a year.
