  * Amazon has released a somewhat strange application called the [Mechanical Turk](http://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome).


  * Yahoo has taken up the challenge of Google Maps: Behold, [Yahoo Maps](http://maps.yahoo.com/beta), a heckuva Flash application (still in beta)!


  * Found this new blog which features gadgets and goodies which are both small and inexpensive: [CheapAndTiny.com](http://www.cheapandtiny.com/).
