I was listening to the news on the way home last night and heard some guy being interviewed about sick days and whether to take a sick day or not. The guy was some union worker and he said that the first thing he learned when he started working at a union shop was to never, ever take a sick day when actually sick. Always drag your ass in to work no matter how sick you are so that you can use your sick days for something fun, like fishing. Seriously, he said fishing. This whole concept is wrong on so many levels, not the least of which is the fact that when you are sick and at work, you are getting everyone else sick. I have already blogged about this before so no more [here](http://www.forkbender.com/content/8b334e87812c4e7c9d65ea78f314a4e3.htm). But it just goes to show yet another reason why businesses don't like unions.
