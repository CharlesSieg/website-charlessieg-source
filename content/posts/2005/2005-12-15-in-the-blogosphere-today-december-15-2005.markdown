  * Apparently Peter Jackson's [remake of King Kong is THREE hours long](http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,69832,00.html?tw=rss.TOP) - twice the length of the 1933 original.


  * It appears that [the cost of a private jet is dropping quickly](http://www.popsci.com/popsci/technology/generaltechnology/32f752bf9edf7010vgnvcm1000004eecbccdrcrd.html). Here's three under $2.5M now, with two of them close to $1M. Am looking forward to hearing about partial ownership plans in these.


  * Good thing [they didn't have this when I was a kid](http://www.popsci.com/popsci/bown2005/hometech/ae7365e470857010vgnvcm1000004eecbccdrcrd.html) - my "forts" would have become more permanent.


  * And for a limited time only, a link to the [lyrics for Gwen Stefani's "Hella Good"](http://www.metrolyrics.com/lyrics/165484994/Hella_good)!


  * The continuing demonstrated incompetence of the Transportation Security Administration: [a 9-month-old baby somehow on the No Fly list](http://news.com.com/Theres+no+getting+off+that+no-fly+list/2100-7350_3-5996897.html)... Nice.


  * Do *NOT* [hit a bird with your Porsche when driving 250 km/h](http://www.yuretz.ru/Vstrecha_s_kuricej_na_skorosti_250_km_chas_p510.html)...not a pretty site. Not even the safety glass will save you then.
