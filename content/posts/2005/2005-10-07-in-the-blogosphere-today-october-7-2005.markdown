  * A searchable online version of [Shakespeare's MacBeth](http://www.asksam.com/cgi-bin/as_web6.exe?Command=First&File=MacBeth).

	
  * Whoa. This python apparently died when it exploded while [trying to eat a whole alligator](http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20051005/ap_on_fe_st/gator_python). There's a gluttony joke in here somewhere.

	
  * Oh, man, here's something for the [next snowboard trip](http://www2.oregonscientific.com/catalog/product.asp?cid=14&scid=63&pid=560)! Awesome!

	
  * Now this is a [ranch](http://www.orviscw.com/properties_overland.html)!

	
  * Apparently, Ahu and I ate at the [8th most expensive restaurant](http://www.forbes.com/2005/10/05/cx_sb_1006featslide_8.html?thisSpeed=35000) in the U.S. while in Las Vegas. It was goooood.
