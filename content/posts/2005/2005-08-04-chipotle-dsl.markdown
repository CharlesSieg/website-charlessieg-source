Finally, Chipotle gets online! Now Chipotle, my favorite purveyor of fajita burrito calorie bombs, has created a new way to order your Southwestern fix. Go to [http://www.chipotle.com/dsl](http://www.chipotle.com/dsl) and place your order online! By the way, the "DSL" part means "Don't Stand in Line!"
