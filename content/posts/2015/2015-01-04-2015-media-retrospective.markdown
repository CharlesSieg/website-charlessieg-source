My wife and I watch movies and TV shows in the evenings to relax.

### Movies Watched at Home

Movies haven't been as interesting lately as TV shows so our time is not spent with many movies. Three of these are kids movies that we saw with Karl and Connor. Two of the others are Academy Award winners and the rest random picks.

* American Sniper
* Big Hero 6
* Book of Life, The
* Chef
* Ex Machina
* Exodus: Gods and Kings
* Imitation Game, The
* Noah
* Wreck-It Ralph

## Movies Watched Alone

When I decided to split this list up into movies watched alone vs. with Ahu, I realized that I actually watch more movies by myself. These movies are those that don't interest Ahu much. Mostly I watch these when I travel (Fury, Godzilla, The Equalizer, and John Wick were all watched on a plane to and from NYC) or after Ahu goes to bed. Some movies, like Cloud Atlas, take several weekends for me to get through watching in small chunks.

* 300: Rise of an Empire
* Cloud Atlas
* Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
* Eastern Promises
* Equalizer, The (Denzel Washington)
* Fury
* Godzilla
* Hanna
* Hobbit: Battle of Five Armies, The
* John Wick
* Jurassic World
* Snowpiercer
* Super 8
* X-Men: Days of Future Past

## Movies Watched in the Theater

This year was sort of a record for us watching movies in the theater. There are two reasons for this. One is that we wanted to see these movies right away and didn't want to wait for them to come to video. This is always the case with a new James Bond or Star Wars movie, as infrequent as they are. The second reason is that the movie theaters near us are more comfortable than they used to be. All seats are like La-Z-Boy recliners and when we go to the Moviehouse & Eatery, there is chairside food and drink service, including alcoholic beverages.

* Martian, The
* Spectre
* Star Wars: The Force Awakens
* Steve Jobs

## TV Shows We Watched

The best video entertainment continues to come in the form of cable TV shows. We love Game of Thrones, Homeland, House of Cards, Luther, and so on - mature content for adults with realistic situations and language. Mr. Robot was a fantastic new addition while the latest incarnation of True Detective was a major disappointment. We continue to get most of our shows by buying them on Apple TV but now have HBO and Showtime subscriptions (through Apple TV) so we can now keep up with the latest from those networks.

* Americans, The - Season 3
* Better Call Saul - Season 1
* Big Bang Theory, The - Season 8, Season 9
* Brink, The - Season 1
* Firefly - finally finished the only season
* Game of Thrones - Seasons 4 and 5
* Homeland - Seasons 4 and 5
* House of Cards - Season 3
* Luther - Seasons 1-3
* Mad Men - The Last Season (7)
* Mr. Robot - Season 1
* Newsroom - Season 3
* Silicon Valley - Season 2
* True Detective - Season 2
* Walking Dead, The - Season 5

Started off watching season 1 of Ballers on HBO. Didn't really care for it and haven't gone back after the first episode or two. We also finally finished the last few seasons of Burn Notice.
