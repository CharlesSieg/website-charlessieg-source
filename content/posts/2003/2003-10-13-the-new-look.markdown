I spent a lot of time this past weekend retooling the ForkBender site and applying a new look and feel to the site. I hope everyone likes it. It is a major departure from the old look. A list of books I've read in the past and movies I seen in the past is now also available. I am getting ready to create a new List content type in Narrative so that I can create Top 10 Lists of favorite books, movies, restaurants, stores, etc.  

  

The picture at the top of this page was taken by me in the French Alps around the town of Chamonix. It was taken halfway up the Aguille du Midi.
