Wow, I'm on a writing binge, here... While sitting back and working on allowing users to leave comments about postings on this site, I was struck with inspiration regarding my current beverage...[Lynchburg Lemonade](http://www.bevmo.com/productinfo.asp?sku=00000001287&area=spirits&category=30090000&sid=03&catname=Prepared%5FCocktails)...

A curious blend of lemon and Jack  

Bottled in yellow and ubiquitous black  

A tasty drink bottled in packs of four  

Gone from my glass as soon as its poured  

Sweet and tangy to buzz just a while  

Enjoy it before bed and sleep with a smile!
