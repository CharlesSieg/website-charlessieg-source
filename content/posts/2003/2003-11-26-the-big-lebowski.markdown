What can I say? This movie is one of my all-time favorites. It's just sooooo funny! The Dude is the epitome of cool, relaxed, and go-with-the-flow. There are so many great scenes, especially the one at the end with the "wind event". Steve Buscemi is sort of wasted in his role but is still an interesting presence. John Turturro makes a pseudo-cameo in his short role as Jesus Quintana, a bowler on another league team. The scene where he is introduced is hilarious!!! In the end, though, this is a love-hate movie and I know a lot of people who think this movie completely sucks. Oh well, their loss! I think it is great and now own a copy so I can watch it whenever I want!
