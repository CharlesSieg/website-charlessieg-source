This is yet another war movie along the lines of Black Hawk Down. The story is nothing special but the casting was done particularly well and there is some interesting cinematography. Owen Wilson plays a wisecracking F-18 navigator whose plane crashes. Gene Hackman is the admiral in charge of Wilson's battle group. Pilot crashes, calls for help, admiral sends help...eventually. There is an awesome scene where an F-18 is literally "chased" by missiles. A vivid sound effects track and innovative camera motion make the movie more appealing.
