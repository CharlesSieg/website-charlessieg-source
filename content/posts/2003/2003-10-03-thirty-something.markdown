Well, today is the big day (for me) - I have finally turned 31 and am officially, "thirty-something" as Ketra has reminded me. Didn't there used to be some TV show called thirty-something? Probably I didn't ever watch it because the age of 30 seemed quite far away. I can think of friends I haven't seen in awhile where the "while" has gotten to be about 8 years or more even though it seems like last month. Time sure does fly.
