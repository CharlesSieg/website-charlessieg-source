I finally got around to watching this movie...only a few years after it was in the theaters. The movie is a somewhat true-to-life story of Carl Brashears, the first African American to become a Master Diver in the U.S. Navy. He is played by Cuba Gooding, Jr. Robert De Niro plays his harsh instructor Billy Sunday. It's a good introduction to the challenges of early diving as the movie takes place before the invention of scuba gear. The divers walk around the bottom of the ocean in brass shoes and attached air hoses. One of the more interesting movies I have seen recently. If the real Carl Brashears is anything like the guy in the movie, he has got to be one of the toughest Navy men in history.
