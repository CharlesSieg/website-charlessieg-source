Anyone who knows me knows that I am not much of a sports fan. I don't pay attention to any of the major sports teams. I don't know the name of all the football, basketball, or baseball teams. I do know three of them, though - Bears, Bulls, and Cubs - as any kid raised in Illinois does. The Bulls were pretty cool there for awhile when Jordan played for them but just as I moved to Chicago, he quit, and now the Bulls are a nothing-special team again. But, miraculously, the Chicago Cubs are, for the first time in 95 years, in contention for a World Series spot. I started paying attention when they played the last game against Atlanta and won that playoff series. Now I've seen all of the three games thus far in the NLCS and last night's game was the best baseball game I've ever seen. I was busy until the 7th inning and tuned into a tie game. The game went back and forth until the climactic finish where that one guy (as if I have picked up the players' names yet...sheesh) got tagged out between 2nd and 3rd base. Awesome. I was having a great time until I looked at the clock. Two hours had passed watching the 7th, 8th, and 9th innings and the extra two in OT. Then I remembered why I never watch sports games. They take up too much time. If I was truly a fan and watch games all season, I would never get anything done. This site would never be updated because I would not have time to write anything. So I resolved to watch as many of the games as I can and then go back to being a non-fan after the Cubs win the World Series. Then I can say I was there when history was made.
