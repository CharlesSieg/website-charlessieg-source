title: 2003 Howard's Grove Run/Walk
---

On September 6th, 2003 we gathered at Howard's Grove in Wisconsin to run a 5K. It was a bright, sunny day and the run went very well. Our group did very well. Chris Peters got 3rd in his age group and my wife Ahu got 3rd in her age group. Tessa's parents each got 1st in their respective age groups. Ahu set a personal best for the 5K and I set a personal best of 27:50 for the 5K. I've run it faster in practice but this was the fastest I ran it in competition. The next race is the Lake Geneva Triathlon next weekend followed by a 5K in Lake Mills, Wisconsin on October 11th.  

  

It should be noted that there are a few pictures of Chris and Tessa's daughter Tristen mixed in with the race pictures. Also, it should be forever noted that Chris was soundly beaten by Dennis. In fact, it is true that Chris, a once reknowned runner, has actually NEVER beaten Dennis in a roadrace...
