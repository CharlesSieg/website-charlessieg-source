I have discovered something truly remarkable. As anyone who knows me knows, I am a big [Chipotle](http://www.chipotle.com/) fan. My Chipotle of choice is a Chicken Fajita Burrito. Of course, this type of fare is not what one would usually consider "diet food". I think a Fajita Burrito weighs in around 2 lbs. At least it feels like 2 lbs. in your stomach once you've eaten the Fajita Burrito.

Last summer I emailed customer service at Chipotle via a questions form on the Chipotle website. I asked them for a nutritional breakdown of a typical Fajita Burrito. The reply I got stated that they did not have a nutritional breakdown for their products and did not have plans to have one done. I was less than chuffed to hear that but assumed that most people really didn't want to know what they are doing to their bodies when they eat a 2 pound burrito.

So I took it upon myself to figure it out. I am the proud owner of the fantastic program [NutriBase, Clinical Edition](http://www.nutribase.com/nbc.shtml). This is the version that dietitians use to figure out - to the nth detail - what their clients should eat, are eating, etc. I created a new "meal" in the system and added all of the ingredients of my Chipotle Chicken Fajita Burrito to the meal. Actually, I calculated the Burrito *Bowl* not the actual Burrito as I have given up the tortilla. For reference, I added the following ingredients in the listed amounts:

* 1 cup of grilled chicken breast, chopped  

* 1.5 cups of white rice  

* 1/2 cup of yellow corn, unsalted  

* 1/2 cup of lettuce (negligible effect on the nutritional content)  

* 3 tablespoons of sour cream  

* 1/2 cup of queso chihuahua  

The results were quite surprising. The nutritional breakdown is as follows:

Calories: ~910  

Carbohydrates: ~95 grams  

Protein: ~67 grams  

Fat: ~19 grams  

The shocking revelation is that these calories are in the 40-30-30 ration prescribed in [The Zone Diet](http://www.zoneperfect.com/Site/Content/index.asp) by [Dr. Barry Sears](http://www.drsears.com/). While the total overall caloric intake is about double the maximum for a given meal, the ratio is exactly right. Get a Chipotle Fajita Burrito Bowl for lunch, eat half and save half for dinner and you are good to go. Adding 1/2 cup of tomatoes (the way my wife likes her Chipotle) adds only about 20 calories to the entire meal. Adding the tortilla, however, adds a ton of carbs and pretty much ruins the Zone ratio.

Anyway, so the next time you have a craving for Chipotle and feel like you are going to blow your diet, don't beat yourself up. Chipotle serves great food and, in moderation, its quite healthy.
