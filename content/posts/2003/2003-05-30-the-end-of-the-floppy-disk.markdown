Today I realized that the floppy disk is truly a thing of the past. I frequently move files between my computer at home and my computer at work using FTP over the Internet. Today, when leaving to go home, I wanted to send myself a Word document to work on over the weekend. When I went to FTP it, I found the network was down for maintenance. Naturally, I thought of the floppy disk drive since the file in question was only 350K in size. Unfortunately, after looking all over for 15 minutes, not a single floppy disk was to be found. I did have a CD burner available and a CD-R, but wasting a 600 MB CD on a 300K file seemed quite the waste to me. Finally I ran into a colleague who had a [Sony Micro Vault](http://www.sony.net/Products/Microvault/). The Micro Vault is essentially a [MemoryStick](http://www.memorystick.org/e-index.html) with a USB connector. The device appears to the computer as a slick, 128 MB hard disk. I put the file in the Vault and took it home, easily transferring it to my PC. The Micro Vault weighs the same as a single floppy disk and is smaller - it fits in a shirt pocket. It also holds the equivalent of approximately 100 floppy disks. It can transfer the file in a second as opposed to waiting a minute or so for a file to load off of a floppy. The disk is done - long live [USB storage](http://www.allnetdevices.com/wireless/news/2002/06/27/the_next.html)! In the future, laptop designers should just leave out the floppy disk drive. It takes up space, drains the battery, and provides minimal benefit. Time for the world to move on.
