This pretty much sums up how I live my life. My parents will remember that I had a poster on my wall with these rules on it throughout my teenage and college years:  





  1. If anything can go wrong, Fix it! (To hell with Murphy!)  


  2. When given a choice â€“ Take Both!  


  3. Multiple projects lead to multiple successes.  


  4. Start at the top then work your way up.  


  5. Do it by the bookâ€¦but be the author!  


  6. When forced to compromise, ask for more.  


  7. If you canâ€™t beat them, join them, then beat them.  


  8. If itâ€™s worth doing, itâ€™s got to be done right now.  


  9. If you canâ€™t win, change the rules.  


  10. If you canâ€™t change the rules, then ignore them.  


  11. Perfection is not optional.  


  12. When faced without a challenge, make one.  


  13. â€œNoâ€ simply means begin again at one level higher.  


  14. Donâ€™t walk when you can run.  


  15. Bureaucracy is a challenge to be conquered with a righteous attitude, a tolerance for stupidity, and a bulldozer when necessary.  


  16. When in doubt: THINK!  


  17. Patience is a virtue, but persistence to the point of success is a blessing.  


  18. The squeaky wheel gets replaced.  


  19. The faster you move, the slower time passes, the longer you live.
