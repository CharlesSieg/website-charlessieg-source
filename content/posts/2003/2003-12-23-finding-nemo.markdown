What is it with this movie??? Everyone seems to like it! I've even heard it was the best movie of the year!!! Come one - you have got to be kidding! I didn't like the movie at all. I will admit that the computer graphics are awesome. Pixar certainly leads the world in this area. But the story was only okay and the voices were not very interesting. In fact, I really disliked the Marlin character (and it has nothing to do with the Cubs). What a whiney guy! Did they get Woody Allen to voice him, because that would have been quite appropriate. The beginning of the movie is almost depressing and the end of the movie is not really exciting. Just didn't like it, what can I say?
