After hearing about the Curse on the Cubs and seeing how they played last night, I have decided that I hate goats. Or at least that loser, idiot, jerk fan who messed up Moises Alou's catch last night. What a colossal faux-pas to make at the worst possible time. The loss of momentum cascaded into a series of setbacks for the Cubs, starting with the error by Gonzalez, then a bunch of hanging pitches from Prior leading to his being taken out of the game, ending with a score of 8 to 3, in favor of the Marlins. All I have to say is that they better win tonight...
