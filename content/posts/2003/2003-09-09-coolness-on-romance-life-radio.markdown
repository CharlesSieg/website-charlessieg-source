Romance Life Radio has almost passed the 200 mark on number of users who have added the station to their presets. I think that is pretty cool - 200 users thought enough of the station to save it for future listening.  

  

On an even more interesting note, I got an email yesterday from a representative of Cottonbelly Productions, a recording studio in New York City. They are working with [SONY Classics](http://www.sonyclassics.com/) on the film score to the film [Northfork](http://www.paramountclassics.com/northfork/), which is featured at the [Sundance Film Festival](http://institute.sundance.org/jsps/site.jsp?resource=pag_ex_home) and is an upcoming featured film. She wanted my address, etc. so she could send me a CD of the score for possible inclusion in the Romance Life Radio playlist!!! How cool is that?!?!?!!! Free music!
