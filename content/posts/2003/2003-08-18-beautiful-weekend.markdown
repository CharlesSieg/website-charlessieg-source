This last weekend was beautiful in Chicago. The temperature was around 80 degrees during the day and dropped to the 60s at night. Ahu and I spent most of our time by the pool reading and getting some sunshine. We went to the [Chicago Botanic Garden](http://www.chicago-botanic.org/) on Sunday. We went to the shady area by the [Rose Garden](http://www.chicago-botanic.org/explore/GardenRose.html) and had ice cream and read our books. Saturday we watched the movie [Amelie](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000640VO/qid=1061236907/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/103-2535584-1674208), which is the first movie we received as part of our [Netflix](http://www.netflix.com) membership. So far, we are really pleased with the Netflix service. Hopefully we will never have to go to [Blockbuster](http://www.blockbuster.com/) again.
