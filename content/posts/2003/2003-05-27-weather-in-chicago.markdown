The [weather](http://weather.yahoo.com/forecast/USIL0225_f.html) in Chicago has been great lately. We have had three perfect days in a row. Memorial Day weekend has probably never had better weather. However, weather in Chicago leaves much, much!, to be desired. Without stating the obvious, the wind is relentless. It is always windy. ALWAYS!!! Especially downtown. Downtown is the worst because it is dusty. There is all this loose junk on the sidewalks and roads and it blows around in the wind and gets in your eyes and hair. Its really quite lovely - a whole new reason to wear [sunglasses](http://www.oakley.com/ostore/eyewear/xx/).
