I just had to write that I have broken the record for [Ms. Pac Man](http://www.klov.com/M/Ms._Pac-Man.html) at [Nickel City](http://www.nickelcitygames.com) in Northbrook, Illinois! It was around 98,000 points and is now approximately 110,000 points.  

You may now continue with your normally scheduled programming.
