I am an ice cream junkie. I admit it. I am guilty. I love ice cream. But I have found that I love frozen custard even more.




For those of you not familiar with the Illinois and Wisconsin areas, there is a restaurant called [Culver's](http://www.culvers.com/), found more and more frequently here, that serves fantastic frozen custard. Frozen custard is a premium ice cream made with a little extra egg yolk to create a more velvety smooth texture. My passion for frozen custard began with a small family-owned store downstate called [Jarling's Custard Cup](http://www.hrtimeout.com/rednews/2002/08/30/build/Dining/dining.php) but Culver's has taken frozen custard to a higher form. I have yet to have less-than-perfect custard experience there and when paired with a delicious ButterBurger, I am truly in heaven.
