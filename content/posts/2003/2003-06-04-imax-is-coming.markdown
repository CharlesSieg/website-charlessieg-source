The [IMAX](http://www.imax.com/) version of the [Matrix Reloaded](http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/) opens on Friday! For those of you thinking you should probably see the movie again to figure out all the confusion, this is the perfect opportunity! What did actually happen there at the end with Neo and the Sentinels??? Just who is this "Bane" fellow and why is he not a nice guy??? The special effects have got to be _incredible_ in the IMAX format. You can buy advance tickets at [Fandango](http://www.fandango.com/movie_page.asp?mv=40584&source=tbo_l).  

  

There is a rumor going around that a certain major accounting firm is letting a certain set of developers out for an "offsite" meeting this coming Monday...who knows where it will be held...
