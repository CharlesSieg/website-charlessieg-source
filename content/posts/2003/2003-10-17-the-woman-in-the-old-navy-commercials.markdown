After watching all these Cubs games lately, you can't help but remember the Old Navy commercials they are showing with the woman walking around with all the guys smiling and winking. After some research I have found out that it is, indeed, Fran Drescher from the television show "The Nanny". I was shocked, actually, because in the commercial she looks to be about 25 years old. Fran Drescher was actually born in 1957 so that puts her at about 46 years of age. I'd say she has aged quite well...
