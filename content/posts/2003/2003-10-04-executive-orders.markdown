This is the best of the Jack Ryan books, in my opinion. The Bear and the Dragon was written after this one but this is still the best. A very compelling and realistic plot. Just like the plot in Debt of Honor was carried out on September 11th, I fully expect that there is some terrorist group out there looking to enact the plot in this novel. Scary stuff but written with genius.
