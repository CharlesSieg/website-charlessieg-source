Just got back from seeing the [Jim Carrey's](http://www.imdb.com/Name?Carrey,%20Jim) new movie, [Bruce Almighty](http://www.brucealmighty.com/). With Jim Carrey in the lead role, they should have called it Bruce Alrighty Then. Not a bad movie and there were several very funny scenes, although the funniest was not even Carrey's. It's good to see Jim Carrey get back into comedies after attempting the whole drama thing with [The Majestic](http://majesticmovie.warnerbros.com/) and [The Truman Show](http://www.imdb.com/Title?Truman+Show,+The+(1998)). The Truman Show was an excellent movie and Carrey's acting talent showed through but Carrey's true gift is his plastic face and quick wit. There is an underlying theme in this movie which embodies Carrey's reacceptance of the comedy genre.
