I just had to drop a quick note to express my utter satisfaction with [Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com)! Several months ago I preordered the latest [Harry Potter book](http://www.scholastic.com/harrypotter/books/phoenix/). When I ordered it, I was still living in the [Loop](http://www.habitat.com/residences.asp?m=intro&id=48&state=IL). After I moved, I forgot to update my address. Well, I forgot until a few days before the book was supposed to be released. I went online and changed my order. I had requested the normal shipping to minimize cost. But lo and behold, my book arrived on Saturday morning, just in time to take with me to the pool! Amazon had upgraded my shipping to FedEx Overnight Saturday delivery for FREE!!! Instead of waiting in all of those crazy lines to get the new book, Amazon had it in my hands on the day it became available, for a very reasonable price, and with free overnight shipping. That's what makes customers like me so loyal to Amazon.com.
