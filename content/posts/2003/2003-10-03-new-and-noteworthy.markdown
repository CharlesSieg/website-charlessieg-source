New and Noteworthy






Â 



	
  * The site went through a complete graphical redesign posted on October 6th.

	
  * I am currently on contract at Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu in Deerfield, Illinois working
on the Deloitte Platform. My resume will be updated with this experience soon.

	
  * I posted my first article on the site. The article demonstrates implementing the
Sieve of Erastosthenes in C# to find prime numbers.
