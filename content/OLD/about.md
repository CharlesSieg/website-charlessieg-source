I am the founder and president of [Renkara Media Group](http://www.renkara.com). We build [AccelaStudy](http://www.accelastudy.com), an accelerated learning platform with millions of users.

My long form CV is [here](/cv).

I grew up in a neighborhood called Sunset Lake outside of the town of Carlock, Illinois, population 400. I went to Carlock Elementary School and then Parkside Junior High School. I went to University High School. I attended Illinois State University.

I've lived in Bloomington, Normal, and Peoria, Illinois. In 2000, I moved to Chicago. I lived in a condo at 600 South Dearborn for awhile. It is also known as the [Transportation Building](http://www.transportationbuilding.org/) and was the headquarters for [Eliot Ness and the Untouchables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliot_Ness) during Prohibition.

I proposed to Ahu on top of the Eiffel Tower in January 2001. We got [married on top of the Sears Tower in Chicago](https://www.flickr.com/photos/forkbender/sets/592400) on March 23rd, 2002 and went on an [epic honeymoon](https://www.flickr.com/photos/forkbender/collections/72157600249752594/).

Our son Karl was born in November, 2008. Our son Connor was born in April, 2010.

Ahu and I and the boys used to live in [Inverness, Illinois](https://www.flickr.com/photos/forkbender/collections/72157600043304959/), a suburb of Chicago. We [moved to Texas](http://www.charlessieg.com/blog/life-in-dallas-so-far) in August 2014 and now live in a small town called Westlake. We moved to Westlake so our sons could attend [Westlake Academy](http://www.westlakeacademy.org/visitors/home.html), an [International Baccalaureate](http://www.ibo.org/) charter school that frequently ranks in the top 50 schools in the United States.

I was a [bodybuilder](/blog/my-life-as-a-bodybuilder), a track cyclist, a triathlete, a rock climber, and an Olympic weightlifter. Now I do yoga and play in the mud every year in the [Chicago Tough Mudder](http://www.charlessieg.com/blog/tough-mudder-chicago-2015-obstacles-to-expect).

I thought I was a certified PADI Rescue Diver but apparently my certification was lost 25 years ago and so I have to retake the course. I was a lifeguard at the Four Seasons Club in Bloomington, Illinois during high school and college.

I am an autocross enthusiast and I race a 2015 Porsche Boxster GTS. I've also raced a 2012 Porsche 911 S. I'm a member of the [Porsche Club of America - Mavericks Region](http://mav.pca.org) and I do autocross events with the [Equipe Radpide](http://www.autocross.com) sports car club.
