I am the founder and president of [Renkara Media Group][1]. We build [AccelaStudy][2], an accelerated learning platform with millions of users.

I provide consulting services to a wide variety of Fortune 1000 clients. I am an expert in iOS development, [Node.js][3] development, and automating the deployment of scalable and highly-available infrastructure, primarily in the AWS cloud. I am an [AWS Certified Solutions Architect][4].

My résumé can be found [here][5]. Copies are available in PDF and Microsoft Word format.

I am a strong proponent of remote work, especially in the Information Technology field and am the editor of the [Remote Technologist publication on Medium][6]. I've worked remotely exclusively since 2010.

I publish a newsletter of interesting articles, videos, and products called [The Weekly Edge][7] on [Revue][8]. Alas, I'm so busy that it should really be called The Quarterly Edge.

I maintain GitHub repos for the [articles][10] I write and a [collection of CloudFormation and Terraform scripts][9] for automated provisioning of AWS infrastructure.
