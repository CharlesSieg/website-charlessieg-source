I am the founder and president of [Renkara Media Group](https://www.renkara.com). We build [AccelaStudy](https://www.accelastudy.com), an accelerated learning platform with millions of users.

I provide consulting services to a wide variety of Fortune 1000 clients. I am an expert in iOS development, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) development, and automating the deployment of scalable and highly-available infrastructure, primarily in the AWS cloud. I am an [AWS Certified Solutions Architect](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/).

My résumé can be found [here][5]. Copies are available in PDF and Microsoft Word format.

I am a strong proponent of remote work, especially in the Information Technology field and am the editor of the [Remote Technologist publication on Medium][6]. I've worked remotely exclusively since 2010.

I publish a newsletter of interesting articles, videos, and products called [The Weekly Edge][7] on [Revue][8]. Alas, I'm so busy that it should really be called The Quarterly Edge.

I maintain GitHub repos for the [articles][10] I write and a [collection of CloudFormation and Terraform scripts][9] for automated provisioning of AWS infrastructure.

You can find me on [Facebook][11], [Twitter][12], [Instagram][13], [Flickr][14], [Pinterest][15], [LinkedIn][16], and [Tumblr][17].

The most popular posts on my blog are [The 10-Year Hoodie][18], [On Telecommuting][19], [My Life as a Bodybuilder][20], and [Renkara Offices][21].

I was a [Red Cross-certified lifeguard](http://www.redcross.org/take-a-class/lifeguarding) at the [Four Seasons Club in Bloomington, Illinois](http://www.4seasons-club.com) during high school and college.

Although I completed the coursework, pool sessions, and open water session to become a certified [PADI Rescue Diver](https://www.padi.com/padi-courses/rescue-diver-course), my certification paperwork was not filed 25 years ago due to a missing CPR certificate and so I have to retake the course. Until then, I have current PADI certifications in [Advanced Open Water](https://www.padi.com/padi-courses/advanced-open-water-diver-course) and [Deep Diving](https://www.padi.com/padi-courses/deep-diver). I received excellent instruction from [Midwest Diving Specialists in Normal, Illinois](https://www.midwest-diving.com). I am a member of the [Divers Alert Network (DAN)](http://www.diversalertnetwork.org).

I grew up in a neighborhood called Sunset Lake outside of the town of [Carlock, Illinois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlock,_Illinois), population 400. I was an Eagle at [Carlock Elementary School](https://www.unit5.org/carlock) and a Python at [Parkside Junior High School](https://www.unit5.org/pjhs). I graduated from [University High School](http://www.uhigh.ilstu.edu). I attended [Illinois State University](https://illinoisstate.edu) and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science from [DePaul University](https://www.depaul.edu).

I'm currently considering enrolling at [Texas A&M University](http://www.tamu.edu) to pursue a [graduate degree in Computer Science](http://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/academics/degrees/cs/mcs).

I've lived in Bloomington, Normal, and Peoria, Illinois. In 2000, I moved to Chicago. I lived in a condo at 600 South Dearborn for awhile. It is also known as the [Transportation Building][1] and was the headquarters for [Eliot Ness and the Untouchables][7] during Prohibition.

I proposed to Ahu on top of the Eiffel Tower in January 2001. We got [married on top of the Sears Tower in Chicago][8] on March 23rd, 2002 and went on an [epic honeymoon][9].

Our son Karl was born in November, 2008. Our son Connor was born in April, 2010.

Ahu and I and the boys used to live in [Inverness, Illinois][10], a suburb of Chicago. We [moved to Texas][11] in August 2014 and now live in a small town called Westlake. We moved to Westlake so our sons could attend [Westlake Academy][12], an [International Baccalaureate][13] charter school that frequently ranks in the top 50 schools in the United States.

I am an autocross enthusiast and haved raced in the 2012 Porsche 911 S, the 2015 Porsche Boxster GTS, and am currently racing the 2013 Porsche 911 4S. I'm a member of the [Porsche Club of America - Mavericks Region](http://mav.pca.org) and I do autocross events with the [Equipe Rapide](http://www.autocross.com) sports car club in Dallas/Fort Worth.

I'm training to race at the [Circuit of the Americas in Austin, Texas](http://www.circuitoftheamericas.com) and hope to one day do some hot laps on the [Nürburgring in Germany](http://www.nuerburgring.de/en/home.html). In preparation for that day, I am working towards the necessary 1,000 laps on [the virtual Nürburgring track in Forza 6 on Xbox One](https://forzamotorsport.net/en-us/games/fm6/tracks/nurburgring).
