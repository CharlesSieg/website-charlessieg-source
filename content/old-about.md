On our honeymoon we explored Turkey, Italy, Switzerland, and France and relaxed in Hawaii at the end. Did manage to do my first two triathlons this year.

Update - 11/5/2003 I had another good friend - John Benson - whom I neglected to remember in my original list above. John is a ghost these days and only mysterious rumors of CIA and special ops make it to my ears ;-) And if none of that is true, than so much the better for me to immortalize the legends online. But John and I go back farther than all of the others, including basketball and track in *junior* high school and that memorable trip to IMSA in Aurora. John was always a good friend, as were the others, even through the Year of Trouble and beyond. Sadly it took a blast from the past for me to remember. Oh, and there is a vicious rumor that Benson beat me in chess a time or two. Must quash that one before it gets any farther. ;-)



1986 : Learned to play chess. Best summer of my life so far. Much camping and swimming.



1985 : I detassled this summer. Yikes. Took the money and bought many games and applications for my awesome Commodore 64. Spent remainder of year in room solving Ultima IV.
