# Big Sky

I'm a fan of the [Big Sky resort](https://bigskyresort.com) in Montana. I'm writing this article in response to the friends and family who have asked about our trips there.

We are a family of four: myself, my wife, and two energetic young boys, ages 10 and 8. Our first trip was in January 2017, from the 3rd until the 10th and our second trip was from December 29th, 2018 until January 4th, 2019. Our first trip was a successful test run and the most recent trip a happy reunion with our now favorite resort.

## Why Big Sky?

### Size and Ability Level Mix

Big Sky is massive and has over [300 runs spanning 4 mountains](https://bigskyresort.com/Documents/Big%20Sky/The%20Resort/W1819/SMALL%20Main%2019.pdf). After 10+ days of skiing in Big Sky, we've only managed to explore less than 10% of the total resort. On our most recent visit, I met a couple who had been skiing for a week with the express goal of never skiing the same run twice.

With the popularity of ski resorts in Colorado, you'd think that the largest resort in America would be there. The largest resort used to be Vail at 5,289 acres. However, in 2013, [Big Sky absorbed an adjacent property called Moonlight Basin](https://www.businessinsider.com/big-sky-gets-gigantic-with-moonlight-merger-2013-9) and the resulting resort grew to 5,806 acres.

Of the 5,800+ total skiable acres, 2,300 of these are set aside for beginner and intermediate skiers leaving the other 3,500 acres for advanced and expert skiers. This equates to a fantastic mix of beginner (15%), intermediate (25%), advanced (42%), and expert (18%) terrain which is perfect for groups and families of mixed ability levels. Think about it: the beginner/intermediate area at Big Sky, by itself, is larger than the total size of most other American resorts.

As of this writing, Big Sky is now the 2nd largest resort in the United States. It was number one until recently when [Park City merged with Canyons Ski Resort](https://www.ksl.com/?sid=35709426&nid=1288) bringing [Park City Mountain Resort](https://www.parkcitymountain.com) to a total of 7,300 skiable acres. Across all of North America, Park City is now the 2nd largest and Big Sky the 3rd largest after [Whistler Blackcomb](https://www.whistlerblackcomb.com) in British Columbia, Canada at 8,171 acres.

I should note that Big Sky is adjacent to yet another resort named [The Yellowstone Club](http://yellowstoneclub.com). The Yellowstone Club is an [elite, private resort](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-the-yellowstone-club-is-so-popular-with-business-moguls-2016-12) consisting of an additional 2,700 skiable acres. For members of The Yellowstone Club, Big Sky actually becomes the largest ski resort in North America with a stunning 8,500 skiable acres.

### Short Lift Lines

Big Sky, while huge, is fairly remote compared to other resorts and, therefore, sees many fewer skiers per day than popular Colorado resorts, even during the busy holiday season. "With an average of two acres per person on the busiest day," Big Sky is never crowded and has been a frequent recipient of "Shortest Lift Lines" awards from various ski magazines and blogs.

Consider this recent record: On December 28th, 2018, 8,000 people skied at Big Sky on 36 lifts. On the same day, Vail (smaller than Big Sky by ~600 acres) served 20,000 skiiers on 31 lifts.

Big Sky keeps upgrading their lifts, too. New for the 2018/2019 season is the [Ramcharger 8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyMFzy-dH2Y): an eight-seat, high-speed lift with extra-wide heated seats and a weather-proof bubble to keep you toasty on your ride (it also catches dropped gloves).

My personal experience at Big Sky this year is that we had to wait in a lift line twice for 5 minutes and that was right after lunch when everyone was getting on one of the central lifts near a popular lunching spot. Other than those two times, we had no waiting at all.

### Vertical Drop and Run Length

Big Sky has a base elevation of 6,800 feet and a peak elevation of 11,166 feet giving a total vertical drop of 4,350 feet. In the United States, only Snowmass has a higher vertical drop at 4,396 feet. For comparison, vertical drops at other US resorts:

Jackson Hole: 4,139 feet (2,500 acres)
Park City: 3,200 feet (7,300 acres)

Jackson Hole has the longest continuous run in American at 7 miles but Big Sky is a relatively close 2nd at 6.1 miles. However, adding up the total length of all runs at a resort, Park City and Big Sky are tied for 1st at 155 miles, 25 miles more than Whistler Blackcomb. In other words, if you could consistently ski 15 miles per day, it would take over 10 days of skiing to cover the entire resort.

### Other Reasons

Being in Montana, Big Sky is the fortunate recipient of a very heavy and consistent snowfall averaging over 400 inches per year with the lowest year-to-year deviation in the Rockies.



## Getting There

Getting to Big Sky is the reason Big Sky is still a relatively small and unknown resort. It's 

Chicago to Big Sky is a 21 hour driving marathon versus a 14 hour drive to Denver.

Even though any final skiing destination of a Denver trip is still ~2 hours further west, Denver is still reachable in a single day of driving from, say, Chicago, and is an easy stopping point for the night. I've made the Chicago to Denver drive multiple times and you can leave Chicago at 7am and easily be checked-in and asleep in Denver by 10pm leaving the short drive to the resort in the morning before the lifts even open.

Driving from Dallas to Denver is even more palatable at 12 hours versus driving to Big Sky at nearly 23 hours.

Who wants to drive an extra 7 hours for Big Sky? No one.

That pretty much leaves flying as the only way to get to Big Sky. Flights arrive and depart from Bozeman-Yellowstone International Airport (BZN), a relatively small but modern facility about 45 miles from Big Sky.

No traffic on road to resort. Uber

Thoughts

Whistler peak elevation is in the 7,000 foot range. Must be much easier to breathe.

Flying out of Dallas on American Airlines? Take an Uber XL to the airport. We didn't and parked and flew out of Terminal D and arrived back in Terminal A, forcing us to hike back over to Terminal D to pick up our car. Alternatively, you can valet the car and the valet will bring it to the correct terminal when you arrive.
